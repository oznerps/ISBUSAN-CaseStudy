#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  PSEi drops 4% in the final minutes of Friday’s trading day...** The **PSEi** finished closed Friday at 5,862 after a shocking last-minute 4% drop, pushing the PSE’s benchmark stock index back to levels that we haven’t seen since September 2022. Looking back in retrospection, analysts provided several reasons for the drop,including the **US Federal Reserve’s** “cautious” stance on inflation ([link](https://business.inquirer.net/504081/psei-nears-15-month-low)), rebalancing of the PSEi and its sister indices ([link](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/business/2025/2/2/us-unveils-sweeping-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-0826)), and the Philippines’ disappointing FY24 and Q4 GDP figures ([link](https://www.bworldonline.com/stock-market/2025/01/30/649999/psei-declines-further-on-gdp-miss-cautious-fed/)). Nearly ₱22 billion in stock changed hands, with ₱594 million in net foreign buying. On a sectoral basis, **Mining and Oil** was the hardest hit (down 6.6%), followed by Industrial (down 5.4%), and Property (down 3.7%). The only sector to gain was **Financial**, which increased 1.0%. The action was even more intense at the individual stock level. The only two notable gainers were the two PSEi inclusions, **Chinabank** [CBC 93.00 ▲38.9%; 1117% avgVol] and **AREIT** [AREIT 42.00 ▲7.7%; 944% avgVol]. The rest of the **“Advances”** table were illiquid playthings. On the **Declines** side, **Alliance Global** [AGI 6.00 ▼20.0%; 710% avgVol] and **San Miguel** [SMC 65.20 ▼20.0%; 792% avgVol] dropped 20%, which wiped away approximately ₱13 billion and ₱39 billion in marketcap respectively. Unfortunately, the rout wasn’t restricted to just those two stocks, as **Nickel Asia** [NIKL 2.17 ▼17.8%; 1230% avgVol], **Bloomberry** [BLOOM 3.43 ▼13.6%; 170% avgVol], **Emperador** [EMI 16.04 ▼11.2%; 579% avgVol], and **Century Pacific** [CNPF 36.65 ▼10.3%; 345% avgVol] all plummeted on big volume.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I’m up to my eyeballs in chats with fellow investors, analysts, and business owners, and while I have heard a consistent drumbeat of nervous and pessimistic FY25 sentiment, I didn’t come across anybody--except for economist Jonathan Ravelas--looking for that kind of drop on Friday. As per his explanation, “How can the market recover when consumers still feel the high prices. 70% of our economy is about consumption. Infra spending and election spending are your positives, and negatives like Trump tariffs, currency volatility and WPS issue. Will you be bullish?” I think this vocalizes the uncertainty that I’ve been trying to communicate for FY25. It’s not that I don’t see paths to growth, it’s that I see so much material uncertainty behind nearly all of the macro inputs. I’m not skilled enough to know how a trade war between the US and China, the US and Canada, and the US and Mexico will impact global trade. I don’t know how that will impact shipping and fuel prices. I don’t know what secondary effects will boil up, what new dynamics will emerge, and how those will impact things like inflation, interest rates, the US Dollar, and oil. I'm expecting the PSEi to bounce back today, but I'm going to be watching very closely to see how enthusiastic (or not) that rebound is, and where the buying enthusiasm is concentrated!

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Citicore parent sells 1.7% block of CREC to pump its float...** **Citicore Renewable Energy** [CREC 3.52 ▼0.8%; 14% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5f2fa9842714b4b7ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that its parent company, **Citicore Power Inc** (CPI), sold 153,741,000 CREC shares in a block sale. According to CREC, the block sale was one of CPI’s conditions precedent to closing the deal with Indonesia’s **PT Pertamina Power** (“Pertamina”), where Pertamina is set to take a 20% stake in CREC. Since the shares sold to Pertamina would count as non-public shares (due to Pertamina’s degree of control through its board seats), CREC’s public float would have fallen below the PSE’s minimum 20% if CPI did not complete this sale prior to the close of the Pertamina deal.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** We didn’t get any details on the price that CPI got for the block sale shares, but the important thing here is that this sale is less than half of the shares that CPI has committed to sell to clear the way for the Pertamina deal. They originally said that they’d sell 346.34 million shares, so after this sale, that still leaves 192.5 million CREC shares that CPI needs to sell. The stock is up 8% over the past month and up 30% from its IPO, but it’s faded over the past week and the market’s crappy vibes can’t be helping matters that much. I don’t have any fears that CPI will fail to competently manage its public float, say like **SP New Energy** [SPNEC 1.15 ▲0.9%; 101% avgVol] did back when it was suspended (and nearly delisted) when the SEC surprised the management team with quick approval of its share swap transaction. There’s no SEC randomizer here. CPI and Pertamina negotiated the terms and the timelines are known. They’ll make it to the finish line.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  JG Summit’s Olefins Corp on “indefinite commercial shutdown”...** **JG Summit** [JGS 16.16 ▼6.5%; 387% avgVol] 
[[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3c490c7f6033f4e9ec6e1601ccee8f59)] confirmed reports that it has placed its money-burning subsidiary, **JG Summit Olefins Corp** (JGSOC), on an “indefinite Commercial shutdown.” JGS said that it “continues to evaluate various options to mitigate the adverse effects of challenging market conditions and to minimize impact to JGS operations and business.” JGSOC has been losing billions each year since the pandemic, and JGS has been forced to inject massive amounts of capital in recent years to prevent JGSOC’s bankruptcy. In January of 2024, JGSOC opened a new petrochemicals manufacturing complex in Batangas, and at the opening, President Marcos said that the plant would “directly and indirectly employ 6,200 individuals”, and that the plant would “enrich our economy by ₱215 billion [in FY25]”. The expansion project cost US $1.3 billion to construct.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** It’s not exactly clear what JGS will do, except that it will attempt to sell its remaining inventory. JGSOC has been a terrible drag on JGS’s profitability over the post-pandemic period. This closure comes at a brutal time for the corporation, considering that it just began full commercial operations of the facility less than a year ago. I don’t have insight into the **Gokongwei Family’s** long-term plans, but I have respect for their willingness to shut it down to avoid incurring more losses. JGSCOC has a massive footprint in terms of both land and buildings, so I’m interested to watch and see what the family will do. Will they exit the business by selling it all off in one batch, or chop it up and repurpose the assets in a painfully slow process that could take years? Any JGS followers have any ideas? This is not a stock that I watch closely.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 195th day of 2025. July is 45% done, and we are 15% of the way through Q3. The year is 53% gone. PSEi is still locked in a fairly sideways band. It’s been 98 days since we last closed in the 5000s, but it’s been 249 days since we last closed in the 7000s.

&gt;  **PH:**  We have no scheduled events this week, but we have plenty of stuff to watch. (1) DigiPlus [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] is down over 40% from its highs, but it’s recovered 5% from its low and is now getting some artificial demand from that ₱6 billion stock buyback program. (2) Island IT [IS 0.07 ▼10.4%; 397% avgVol] is down 52% from its March 2021 price over its first five trading days, all with red candles. (3) Trump decided to give the Philippines a 20% tariff rate (higher than the original 17%), but President Marcos is scheduled to meet with US representatives sometime in the next four weeks. 

&gt;  **International:**  We get June inflation data for the US on Wednesday morning, plus jobs data on Friday.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** If I’m being honest, nothing has caused me to pull out my personal finance spreadsheet as quickly as the news that **Trump** is actively seeking to remove **Jerome Powell**, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, and replace him with someone willing to implement a 300 basis point cut. When the stock market is pumping. When asset prices are flying. What would that kind of move do to the US Dollar? What would that do to the price of gold? What will happen with US stocks? Rate cuts are usually pump parties, and those are well-attended by crypto and all of its weird cousins. But what will the near-term consequences be? What about the long-term consequences?

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DoubleDragon still pushing for industrial REIT...** **DoubleDragon** [DD 11.04 ▲1.3%; 18% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d9598ca7dd348e53ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said that it has completed the construction of a 5-hectare **CentralHub** warehouse complex in Cebu. The property company of **Edgar Sia II** and **Tony Tan Caktiong** said the project brings its total gross floor area to 1.5 million square meters, which is a “milestone” that is in line with DD’s goal of establishing a ₱24.8-billion warehouse leasing portfolio and listing the Philippines’ first ever industrial REIT. CentralHub is a joint venture between DD and **Jollibee** [JFC 227.00 ▼0.4%; 56% avgVol].
&gt;    - ***MB:*** As someone who has been searching for a dedicated cold chain and logistics play that I could invest in, I probably don’t need to tell you that I think CentralHub is a gem. That part (to me) is indisputable. DD seemed to think so, too, since they used a huge percentage of the proceeds from the DDMPR IPO on CentralHub. I’ve made a lot of noise in the past (even last week) about how badly the DD team has neglected **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.07 unch; 94% avgVol] shareholders, and that this focus on CentralHub, combined with their seeming refusal to inject CentralHub assets into DDMPR, just rubs salt in those deep wounds of neglect. While I still think that the DD team has basically abandoned DDMPR shareholders, I don’t want to see these prime CentralHub assets into DDMPR just to make DDMPR better. The DD team has plenty of retail assets in its CityMall portfolio that are actually better suited to blend with DDMPR’s existing portfolio. So, DD team, when are you going to actually do it? When are you going to list this industrial REIT? There’s been plenty of action in the cold storage and logistics space recently. The valuations are great. The trends are great. Don’t overbake this thing like Globe is doing to GCash. Let investors get involved before it becomes too heavy.

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  DigiPlus spent ₱117-M to slow the bleeding...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5cc1a9d01067bc96ec6e1601ccee8f59)] told the Exchange that it repurchased 3 million shares on 10 July 2025, kicking off a ₱6-billion buyback program after suffering from a brutal sell-off triggered by a proposed legislation to curb online gambling. The total amount of shares repurchased was at ₱117.74 million, with the price ranging between ₱37.20 and ₱40. PLUS ended the previous trading week down by 4.3%.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t think this buyback program has the “juice” to overwhelm motivated sellers. To put it in perspective, PLUS has already had several trading days this month with value traded figures in excess of ₱2 billion. At that level, this fund is barely three days’ worth of support. Now, true, those ₱2 billion days were exceptional in that they were the market’s reaction to the Senate’s proposed regulatory action, but what I’m saying here is that this buyback program is like a bandaid for a bullet wound. It’s not going to be enough, on its own, to solve this problem. Of course it will help stabilize PLUS’s stock price, but it needs to be deployed strategically to maximize the benefit because they simply just didn’t put enough cash in this fund to be careless with it. PLUS is one of the most actively traded stocks on the PSE, and it’s had a crazy amount of capital flow into it over the past year. I personally think this was (and still is) a buying opportunity, but there’s still a lot of risk here. I don’t have inside info, and I can’t predict the result of the political game between the President, the Senate, and the House on a populist issue like internet gaming. I think the government will have a hard time turning its back on all this revenue, but we heard the same arguments from PAGCOR about POGOs that it’s making now about e-gaming (that it’s essential to fund government programs, etc), and we all know how that story ended for POGOs. This situation is different, since there isn’t the xenophobic angle that always made POGOs such an easy punching bag, but it’s related. POGOs and e-gaming aren’t brothers, but they’re definitely cousins.

Sorry for that massive gap in delivery last week, I had some kind of virus that left me with a brain fog that robbed my ability to string sentences together. Literally. Not cool. 

Thankfully, I've put it behind me and it seems like the rest of my family got through it unaffected!

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 195th day of 2025. July is 45% done, and we are 15% of the way through Q3. The year is 53% gone. PSEi is still locked in a fairly sideways band. It’s been 98 days since we last closed in the 5000s, but it’s been 249 days since we last closed in the 7000s.

&gt;  **PH:**  We have no scheduled events this week, but we have plenty of stuff to watch. (1) DigiPlus [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] is down over 40% from its highs, but it’s recovered 5% from its low and is now getting some artificial demand from that ₱6 billion stock buyback program. (2) Island IT [IS 0.07 ▼10.4%; 397% avgVol] is down 52% from its March 2021 price over its first five trading days, all with red candles. (3) Trump decided to give the Philippines a 20% tariff rate (higher than the original 17%), but President Marcos is scheduled to meet with US representatives sometime in the next four weeks. 

&gt;  **International:**  We get June inflation data for the US on Wednesday morning, plus jobs data on Friday.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** If I’m being honest, nothing has caused me to pull out my personal finance spreadsheet as quickly as the news that **Trump** is actively seeking to remove **Jerome Powell**, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, and replace him with someone willing to implement a 300 basis point cut. When the stock market is pumping. When asset prices are flying. What would that kind of move do to the US Dollar? What would that do to the price of gold? What will happen with US stocks? Rate cuts are usually pump parties, and those are well-attended by crypto and all of its weird cousins. But what will the near-term consequences be? What about the long-term consequences?

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DoubleDragon still pushing for industrial REIT...** **DoubleDragon** [DD 11.04 ▲1.3%; 18% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d9598ca7dd348e53ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said that it has completed the construction of a 5-hectare **CentralHub** warehouse complex in Cebu. The property company of **Edgar Sia II** and **Tony Tan Caktiong** said the project brings its total gross floor area to 1.5 million square meters, which is a “milestone” that is in line with DD’s goal of establishing a ₱24.8-billion warehouse leasing portfolio and listing the Philippines’ first ever industrial REIT. CentralHub is a joint venture between DD and **Jollibee** [JFC 227.00 ▼0.4%; 56% avgVol].
&gt;    - ***MB:*** As someone who has been searching for a dedicated cold chain and logistics play that I could invest in, I probably don’t need to tell you that I think CentralHub is a gem. That part (to me) is indisputable. DD seemed to think so, too, since they used a huge percentage of the proceeds from the DDMPR IPO on CentralHub. I’ve made a lot of noise in the past (even last week) about how badly the DD team has neglected **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.07 unch; 94% avgVol] shareholders, and that this focus on CentralHub, combined with their seeming refusal to inject CentralHub assets into DDMPR, just rubs salt in those deep wounds of neglect. While I still think that the DD team has basically abandoned DDMPR shareholders, I don’t want to see these prime CentralHub assets into DDMPR just to make DDMPR better. The DD team has plenty of retail assets in its CityMall portfolio that are actually better suited to blend with DDMPR’s existing portfolio. So, DD team, when are you going to actually do it? When are you going to list this industrial REIT? There’s been plenty of action in the cold storage and logistics space recently. The valuations are great. The trends are great. Don’t overbake this thing like Globe is doing to GCash. Let investors get involved before it becomes too heavy.

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  DigiPlus spent ₱117-M to slow the bleeding...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5cc1a9d01067bc96ec6e1601ccee8f59)] told the Exchange that it repurchased 3 million shares on 10 July 2025, kicking off a ₱6-billion buyback program after suffering from a brutal sell-off triggered by a proposed legislation to curb online gambling. The total amount of shares repurchased was at ₱117.74 million, with the price ranging between ₱37.20 and ₱40. PLUS ended the previous trading week down by 4.3%.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t think this buyback program has the “juice” to overwhelm motivated sellers. To put it in perspective, PLUS has already had several trading days this month with value traded figures in excess of ₱2 billion. At that level, this fund is barely three days’ worth of support. Now, true, those ₱2 billion days were exceptional in that they were the market’s reaction to the Senate’s proposed regulatory action, but what I’m saying here is that this buyback program is like a bandaid for a bullet wound. It’s not going to be enough, on its own, to solve this problem. Of course it will help stabilize PLUS’s stock price, but it needs to be deployed strategically to maximize the benefit because they simply just didn’t put enough cash in this fund to be careless with it. PLUS is one of the most actively traded stocks on the PSE, and it’s had a crazy amount of capital flow into it over the past year. I personally think this was (and still is) a buying opportunity, but there’s still a lot of risk here. I don’t have inside info, and I can’t predict the result of the political game between the President, the Senate, and the House on a populist issue like internet gaming. I think the government will have a hard time turning its back on all this revenue, but we heard the same arguments from PAGCOR about POGOs that it’s making now about e-gaming (that it’s essential to fund government programs, etc), and we all know how that story ended for POGOs. This situation is different, since there isn’t the xenophobic angle that always made POGOs such an easy punching bag, but it’s related. POGOs and e-gaming aren’t brothers, but they’re definitely cousins. Hopefully (for PLUS shareholders) they’re distant cousins, like the type you see so infrequently that you need to do flashcards on the ride over to the dinner to remember their names.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[Q3]  Philippine Airlines Q3 profit: ₱789M (down 82% y/y)...** **Philippine Airlines** [PAL 5.24 ▼1.1%; 673% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3cb022eb44cf5725abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of ₱789 million, down 82% y/y from its Q3/23 net income of ₱4,278 million, and down 70% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of ₱2,590 million. On a 9M basis, PAL’s net income was down 58% to ₱8,075 million. PAL declined to comment specifically on its Q3 results, but in a press release contextualized the huge drop in 9M profitability on a 3.68% drop in passenger revenues to ₱115.66 billion (down from ₱120.08 billion). PAL said that its passenger volume increased by 6.4% to 11.71 million passengers, but that its “yield per passenger” dropped by 6.9% (not nice) “due to increased competition in the market.” The Tan Family’s airline noted higher cargo and ancillary revenues, but also higher consolidated operating expenses, which increased 9.5% to ₱109.7 billion. PAL attributed this increase to an uptick in round-trip flights, and maintenance expenses, which increased 12% to ₱17.5 billion. PAL President and COO, **Stanley Ng**, is quoted in the press release as saying “we are continuing to see a moderation in growth and a more challenging business environment where rising costs exert greater pressure on the economics of airline operations.”
&gt;    - ***MB:*** For those who were around the PSEi trading in the 2010s and who personally witnessed PAL’s bankruptcy and emergence from that process in early 2022, the story of how this airline survived is something that sticks with you. But as entertaining as the story of an old man incinerating his billions can be, what really matters to the public float is how the stock has performed since PAL’s rise from the ashes. That’s where the bad news starts. Well, actually the bad news starts with the company’s name (which contains the word “airlines”), but that’s a story for a different post. PAL re-debuted on the PSEi trading at around ₱6.50/share, then dropped to a ₱5.50 to ₱6.00/share range in mid-2022, and then dropped to a ₱5.00 to ₱5.50/share range in mid-2023. We’re kind of on the ugly side of that range now, with PAL having spent a number of months this year hovering gently over the ₱5.00 level. I’ve had some people ask me if PAL (or its main rival, **Cebu Pacific** [CEB 31.30 ▼1.7%; 135% avgVol]) form part of my middle-class thesis, and while that could have been the case with CEB back before the pandemic when planes, parts, and passengers were all plentiful and available, COVID and everything that has happened after it has shown me in clear terms that airlines are too risky for my blood. They’re so exposed. Fuel risk. Foreign exchange risk. Climate risk. Travel restriction risk. Procurement risk. Political risk. It’s just such a mess. As evidenced here by this dramatic downtick in profitability from just a small dip in passenger volume.

&gt;- **[Q3]  Jollibee Q3 profit: ₱3.0B (up 18% y/y)...** **Jollibee** [JFC 259.40 ▼0.2%; 179% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=53d78c9f1e6d8202abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of ₱2.98 billion, up 18% y/y from its Q3/23 net income of ₱2.53 billion, and down 6% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of ₱3.19 billion. On a 9M basis, JFC’s net income was up 23% y/y to ₱8.88 billion, its system-wide sales increased 12% to ₱281 billion, and its revenue increased 10% to ₱196 billion. Worldwide Q3 same-store sales growth was 5.7%, with the greatest gains in the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf segment (+10.7%) and the Europe, Middle East, Asia region (+10.5%). Two segments experienced same-store sales pullbacks: China (-12.1%) and Highlands Coffee (-2.5%). JFC said that it had a total of 9,598 stores globally at the end of Q3, an increase of 43% y/y thanks to the addition of 2,580 **Compose Coffee** stores and 4.4% systemwide organic growth. The Compose Coffee acquisition, which closed at the end of the third quarter, contributed 4.6% to JFC’s systemwide sales.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** JFC’s pivot into international coffee cannot be understated, but unless JFC has its sights set on picking off one of Japan’s leading brands (Japan is the top consumer of coffee in Asia), it’s going to have to consider Indonesia for its next move. The top four coffee consumers are Japan (difficult/expensive), China (difficult), South Korea (already bought Compose Coffee), and Indonesia. One of the biggest coffee companies in Indonesia is **Kopi Kenangan**, which has recently announced its goal to become “the biggest coffee chain in Southeast Asia. If the bee is going to be all about the buzz, maybe its next push is in this direction. I have no special information about JFC’s strategy, and I’ve not read anything to suggest that they’re planning to continue this strategy of picking off one of the biggest coffee companies in each of the coffee-craziest countries in SE Asia. But if they were, that’s an interesting place to look. Complete speculation on my part!

&gt;- **[NEWS]  The Keepers to acquire Booze On-Line...** **The Keepers** [KEEPR 2.17 ▲4.8%; 436% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=01ba65952e12144fabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] is planning to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of **Booze On-Line, Inc** (BOLI). According to its website ([boozeshop.ph](http://boozeshop.ph/)), BOLI is “one of the leading companies engaged in importing and distributing global wines, spirits, and premium beers.” It is the exclusive distributor of **Hoegaarden, Stella Artois, Becks, Leffe, Paulaner, Chimay**, and **Delirium Tremenes**. BOLI’s site claims that it has “over 350 customers around the country”, including “key on-premise accounts like The Distillery, Draft Gastro Pub, Olive Cerveceria, Beso Cucina Vinoteka, and Imperial Ice Bar”. KEEPR did not disclose the value of the acquisition, but indicated that it is below KEEPR’s reporting threshold (&gt;10% KEEPR’s book value). KEEPR is owned by **Lucio Co**, and specializes in imported wines and spirits.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t have any experience with BOLI or any special knowledge of the imported alcohol industry, but from a quick review of BOLI’s website, this looks like an acquisition that (1) consolidates KEEPR’s marketshare of certain premium spirits brands like Johnnie Walker and Jose Cuervo (among many others), and (2) smash-cuts KEEPR into the premium beer business with a collection of exclusive distributorships and what sounds like a mature sales channel for those brands. I don’t know how many of BOLI’s 350 customers are already in the KEEPR network for its premium wines and spirits. Some are bound to be redundant. But the bigger prize is that KEEPR will now have a bunch of new products that it can sling to its existing clients along its existing distribution channels. This seems like an easy add.

BOLI’s site claims that it has “over 350 customers around the country”, including “key on-premise accounts like The Distillery, Draft Gastro Pub, Olive Cerveceria, Beso Cucina Vinoteka, and Imperial Ice Bar”. KEEPR did not disclose the value of the acquisition, but indicated that it is below KEEPR’s reporting threshold (&gt;10% KEEPR’s book value). KEEPR is owned by **Lucio Co**, and specializes in imported wines and spirits.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t have any experience with BOLI or any special knowledge of the imported alcohol industry, but from a quick review of BOLI’s website, this looks like an acquisition that (1) consolidates KEEPR’s marketshare of certain premium spirits brands like Johnnie Walker and Jose Cuervo (among many others), and (2) smash-cuts KEEPR into the premium beer business with a collection of exclusive distributorships and what sounds like a mature sales channel for those brands. I don’t know how many of BOLI’s 350 customers are already in the KEEPR network for its premium wines and spirits. Some are bound to be redundant. But the bigger prize is that KEEPR will now have a bunch of new products that it can sling to its existing clients along its existing distribution channels. This seems like an easy add.

Also, a look into steel making and the future of ""Green Steel"" and decarbonization. News on Section 232 Tariffs. Lots to share!","Good evening!

As I posted earlier today, I believe we are in the stages of rotation out of Big Tech and other overstretched evaluated stocks into VALUE and RECOVERY plays - which are cyclicals.

This is why we saw increases today in oil, airlines, hotels, cruise lines, steel, metals, etc.

The only cyclical we didn't see gains in was auto manufacturers - I believe this is directly linked to the current chip shortage and auto manufacturers are idling plants due to this.

Also, $TSLA is in bear market territory, off 20% from it's recent highs and dragging the entire EV sector down with it - I think we will see further dips for reasons other than chip shortages, which I explain below.

$NIO, $XPEV &amp; $LI are also down roughly 20% from their highs during the same time period.

Which brings me to inflation.

We now have a potential for higher inflation.

**Increasing inflation, a growing concern in the market, tends to punish high-growth stocks more than low-growth stocks because of the way financial discount rates work.  Most of Tesla's cash flow comes in futures years and future cash flow is worth less today when interest rates rise.**

This example can be applied to all high-growth stocks, thus the exodus from a lot of the names that have fueled the rally the last 10 months.

Where is the money going?

For now:

# Cyclical Stocks

Cyclical companies follow the trends in the overall economy, which makes their stock prices very volatile. When the economy grows, prices for cyclical stocks go up. When the economy turns down, their stock prices will drop. They follow all the cycles of the economy from expansion, peak, and recession all the way to recovery.

Cyclical stocks represent companies that make or sell discretionary items and services that are in demand when the economy is doing well. They include restaurants, hotel chains, airlines, furniture, high-end clothing retailers, and automobile manufacturers. These are also the goods and services that people cut first when times are tough.

When people delay or stop buying anything dispensable, the revenues of the companies that produce and sell them fall. This, in turn, puts pressure on their stock prices, which start to drop. In the event of a long downturn, some of these companies may even go out of business.

# China back in seaborne billet market after 10 weeks

**China has returned to the seaborne billet market on the back of strong domestic demand, to end an absence that lasted around 10 weeks**, sources said.  
 

**Chinese buyers have bought at least 200,000 mt of billet from India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the   Middle East since Feb. 9**, of which about 120,000 mt was concluded over Feb. 18-19 with the other deals done in the last two trading days before the Chinese Lunar New Year break that started Feb.11.  
 

**Deal prices surged to $580-$585/mt CFR China over Feb. 18-19 for 3SP/4SP 150 mm material from   Indonesia and Vietnam for March/April shipment**, two Chinese traders said, up $25-$30/mt from before the holiday.  
 

Meanwhile, a 30,000 mt Indian cargo was bought at $565/mt CFR China for 3SP   150 mm on Feb. 18, which was cheaper due to import duty, an eastern Chinese   trader said, and up about $20/mt from Feb. 10.  
 

March and April mark the traditional peak season in China.  
 

Tangshan Q235 billet was assessed at Yuan 4,220/mt ($647/mt, or $573/mt after value added tax is deducted), up Yuan 260/mt from Feb. 5, according to S&amp;P Global Platts data.  
 

In Jiangsu province, a hub for billet imports, the spot price jumped to Yuan 4,250-4,300/mt after the holiday, which indicated an import margin of about $3-$5/mt given import prices at $580/mt CFR for Asian origin cargo.

With the price of imports having surged, leading to slim margins, traders will likely take a pause, said a second eastern Chinese trader.  
 

“Port congestion or rising freight can easily kill the current paper margin,"" another Chinese trader said.  
 

Platts assessed China import billet for 3SP 150 was assessed at $574/mt CFR   China on Feb. 19, up $33/mt from Feb. 8.  
 

# Asian billet hits one-month high on rising demand

 

Southeast Asian billet continued to rise for the third trading day Feb. 19, hitting one-month high, as sellers maintained high-end offers and withdrew low-end ones amid strong demand from Chinese buyers.  
 

S&amp;P Global Platts assessed Southeast Asia 5SP 130 mm spot billet at a midpoint of $570/mt CFR Manila Feb. 19, up $5/mt day on day.  
 

In the Philippines, mainstream offers were at $585/mt CFR Manila from Vietnam, Indonesia, with low-end selling indication lifted to over $570/mt CFR, up $5/mt on the day.  
 

A major Vietnamese mill kept its offer at $566-$570/mt FOB for 3SP/5SP material, or about $585-$590/mt CFR Manila.  
 

**“Demand is picking up in both Vietnam and Philippines amid rising scrap prices,""** said a   Vietnamese mill source.  
 

Meanwhile, Indonesian and Japanese cargo was offered at $585/mt CFR Manila for 3SP and 5SP material, respectively, said market sources.  
 

However, buyers were still in holiday mood and traders expected to receive price inquiries from the week starting Feb. 22, said two traders.  
 

Chinese market extended strong rally in spot market on the back of bullish   sentiment. Tangshan Q235 billet was assessed at Yuan 4,220/mt ($652/mt or $578/mt after value added tax deducted), up Yuan 40/mt from Feb. 18.  
 

On expectation of strong demand in peak season in March and April and positive import margin, several Chinese traders booked imported billet with total amount of about 120,000 mt at $580-$585/mt CFR China for 3SP 150 mm of   March/April shipment in past two trading days.  
 

The most actively traded rebar May 2021 contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed at Yuan 4,524/mt, down Yuan 5/mt, or 0.1%, day on day.

Coking coal prices are approaching mid 2017 levels \(Premium Low Vol on this chart is coking coal\).](https://preview.redd.it/20bdxmi015j61.png?width=1524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ee98571e45366ee8c5c723b303a006f891e9d6d)



# WEEKLY MET COAL WRAP: Asia met coal prices diverge in China,   ex-China markets

 

Asian metallurgical coal prices moved in differing directions in China and ex-China markets in the week ended Feb. 19, with offers lowered on an FOB Australian basis to entice demand, while the latest transaction concluded higher in China.  
 

S&amp;P Global Platts assessed the Premium Low-Vol HCC down $2/mt on week to $138/mt FOB Australia Feb. 19, while delivered prices to China rose $1.50/mt to $223.50/mt CFR China.  
 

The spot market observed limited trading in the ex-China markets, with firm offers trending lower but failing to find buyers.  Thin buying interest was observed in the spot market as many chose to adopt a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainties on demand outlook, market sources said.  
 

In China, most of the market participants were back from Lunar New Year holiday, and prices edged higher with buying interest emerging in the premium coking coal segment.  Some other market sources said the outlook for prices is subject to both steel mills’ demand and availability of spot premium coking coals going forward.  The arbitrage between domestic and seaborne premium   coking coal narrowed to around $15/mt, following the uptick in seaborne prices, according to Platts data.  
 

The Chinese domestic coke market saw thin activity post-holidays as most buyers were waiting on the sidelines. **Some market participants said the relative low inventory level observed across different steel mills would lead to steady demand for coke in the near term.**  
 

In the ex-China market, despite weakness observed for premium coking coals on an FOB Australia basis, **delivered prices to India moved up quickly due to the recent Panamax freight rally.**  Platts assessed met coal dry bulk Panamax freight between Australia-India at $22.50/mt Feb 19, up $6.80/mt on week.  
 

# India resumes rebar exports after 6-month hiatus with competitive prices

 

**India resumed rebar exports Feb. 18 after a six-month hiatus** as its prices prove competitive with supplies from other origins such as   Turkey and China, market sources said Feb. 19.  
 

Several deals were heard in Singapore and Hong Kong for sales by two major Indian rebar exporters, JSPL and JSW, to end-users on Feb. 18.  The deals were booked by traders before the Lunar New Year at $610/mt CFR Singapore theoretical weight for April shipment and sold to end-users as position   cargoes, market sources said.  
 

These were the first export trades from India since August 2020, according to S&amp;P Global Platts observations.  
 

“Currently Indian mills are bullish on prices. Chinese futures are also increasing,” a trader in India said, adding that JSW was not allocating more rebar for export after the deals and JSPL was striving for above $635/mt CFR Singapore.  
 

A mill source in India said domestic demand has been strong and domestic prices were high, equating to $635/mt in Mumbai, reducing interest in export sales.  
 

However, export prices for Indian rebar were currently lower than from origins such as Turkey and China at $645/mt CFR Singapore and $665/mt CFR Singapore, respectively.  
 

“I think they want to export the excess material so that they \[India mills\] don't have selling pressure in the domestic market,” a second India trader said.



# US rebar prices unchanged, import market muted

 

Domestic and import rebar prices were unchanged on Feb. 19, amid largely steady market conditions.  
 

On Feb. 19, Platts' weekly Southeast US rebar assessment was flat from the previous week at $775-$800/ton, while Platts’ weekly Midwest US rebar   assessment was unchanged at $780-$805/ton.  
 

While the market contended with transportation issues amid the winter weather conditions in some regions, market sources indicated unchanged domestic prices.  
 

**A Midwest distributor said there were “no new price adjustments” by the mills amid the firm outlook for March scrap pricing and lack of imports.**  
 

Midwest rebar prices were holding firm despite a weather-related slowdown in demand, said a Midwest mill source.  The source saw the tradable range at $790-$810/ton at the mill.  
 

Some sources noted lower pricing in the Northeast, but added mills in other regions remained firm on prices.  
 

A Midwest fabricator and Southern fabricator agreed prices were flat despite weather conditions impacting transportation and production at some mills.  
 

# Steel scrap market weighs impact of US winter storms

 

Scrap market participants on Feb. 19 were weighing the impact of winter storms that struck the Central US, as the weather earlier in the week disrupted steel and raw material production and transportation in much of the US.  
 

The freezing temperatures, ice and snowfall slowed raw material flows, hindered trucking and barge scrap transportation, and impacted steel production at several mills in the region, market sources said.  
 

""Down South, you know they're not used to this \[weather\], so trucks aren't moving, barges aren't moving,"" one supplier said. ""It's definitely going to affect the market.""  
 

Disruptions due to weather will have a bigger impact on scrap supply than steel production, another supplier said, with inbound flows heard to be off by 50% in some cases.  
 

""I know some yards were closed Monday and Tuesday for sure, along with several stamping plants down at least Monday and Tuesday,"" a Southern trader said.  Additionally, multiple mills were running at limited capacity throughout the region, he said.  
 

One supplier believed the impact to steel demand and difficulties on the raw material supply side are likely to even out.  
 

""Any steel production capacity taken out by the weather this month will just be offset by lack of scrap inbound,"" he said.  
 

With the cold temperatures expected to rise in the coming days, a mill buyer said he expected activity to pick up.  
 

""I think guys will be able to pick up the pace and catch up,"" he said.  
 

# Iron ore plays a critical role in decarbonizing steelmaking. What does greener steel mean for global iron ore markets? And what part will China play in driving change?  Global steel and iron experts weigh in. 

[https://www.fastmarkets.com/article/3974510/iron-ores-critical-role-in-decarbonizing-steelmaking](https://www.fastmarkets.com/article/3974510/iron-ores-critical-role-in-decarbonizing-steelmaking)

Steel producers have yet to shake their heavy reliance on primary iron ore, and coke, the big polluter. Most iron ore producers are still at the very early stages of formulating a decarbonization strategy. Today, low-carbon steel has a tiny share of global steel markets, and the energy-intensive steel industry produces more carbon than steel.   


We asked leading steel and iron ore experts how iron ore can help shape the future of steelmaking, what these changes might mean for global iron ore markets, and what role China will play. 

**The steel industry produces more carbon than steel. How will the industry respond to pressure to clean up production, and what does that mean for markets?** 

 As surprising as it may seem, the steel industry produces more carbon than steel. For every tonne of crude steel produced, there is almost twice as much carbon produced. The challenge in cutting carbon emissions for industry is that a third of its energy demand is for high-temperature heat and, so far, there are few mature alternatives to fossil fuels.

Merely improving existing integrated steelmaking methods will not be sufficient to cut emissions and meet climate goals. The question is, how can we get away from coke, the big polluter?  


The average integrated plant in Europe is close to 50 years old and this has increased the appetite for investing in emerging technologies. Some European steelmakers are now leading the development and commercialization of hydrogen-based DRI.  


There is simply not enough top quality iron ore or scrap to meet the high DRI quality criteria, so BF-BOF steelmaking, which relies on primary iron units and metallurgical coal, will continue to be the dominant processing route in steelmaking for some time.

*Miriam Falk, Senior Analyst* 

**Is the global iron ore industry fit for purpose?** 

  
To succeed in decarbonizing the global steelmaking industry there needs to be a greater recognition of how much the iron ore supply base needs to change. Vast volumes of existing production will need to be replaced by higher-grade supply, first to meaningfully reduce CO2 emissions from the prevailing BF/BOF technology, and later to meet the demands of a DRI sector at least an order of magnitude larger than it is today.  
   
Iron is not a rare element, but producing the right kinds of ore whilst also meeting increasingly stringent ESG standards is set to be a huge challenge over the coming decades. The per-tonne cost base will have to be significantly higher than the low double-digits we are accustomed to, though even greater price differentiation between product grades according to their emissions profile upon consumption should increasingly offset this. Unless more forward-thinking investments are made, ore supply will be a major rate-determining bottleneck in decarbonization ambitions.

*Peter Hannah, Index Manager*  
 

**China’s steelmaking sector is evolving quickly. How might this impact global iron demand?** 

  
China’s mammoth steelmaking industry will continue to evolve and change in the coming years, especially with the continued drive by the Chinese government to reduce carbon emissions and increase living standards for its citizens.   


For example, China is attempting to reduce its dependency on imported raw materials by instituting strict capacity replacement ratios for blast furnaces and encouraging more scrap-based electric-arc furnaces in its steelmaking industry. However, at the same time, it is heavily reliant on iron ore and coking coal as the key steelmaking raw materials.  


Another key development to watch will be its continual re-structuring of the major Chinese steelmakers, some of which are state-directed. This will create new bases of market power in the region.  


The changes in ferrous trade flows and commodity pricing will be interesting to watch across the entire supply chain as they react to the changing market environment.

Finally and update on Section 232 Tariffs

Given delays due to COVID-19, the WTO recently announced it doesn’t expect to rule in [these](https://insidetrade-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/trade/wto-dispute-panels-push-section-232-resolution-second-half-2021) cases, or in the [cases](https://insidetrade-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/trade/wto-reports-us-challenges-section-232-retaliation-delayed-2021) the U.S. filed in response, until the latter half of 2021. The Biden administration should use the extra time to negotiate out of this mess. 

More broadly, a Biden trade “reset” will have to [start](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/527032-on-day-1-bidens-trade-policy-should-focus-on-europe-not-asia-or-the) with the EU. Like other U.S. allies, the EU was stunned by Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, and his threats to employ Section 232 on their exports of autos. Biden needs to address the future of Section 232 to calm allies, and appease members of congress who have been busy drafting legislation to rein it in. 

As I have said before, I have a trade attorney that is active in Section 232 and Section 301 and the consensus is the tariffs will not go away in one fell swoop, if they go at all.  Biden has already held up the Aluminum Tariffs.

This will be a razor blade, tight-rope to walk, between US steel manufacturers and the desire of the Biden administration to normalize relations with our allies in Europe.

If the tariffs go, they will be in incremental decreases over time not to hurt the market.

It will be digestible and I believe it will be also contingent on the roll back of Chinese exports that come through Europe and find their way to the US.

The move, IMHO, is to garner support from the EU in addition to US pressure to ensure China reduces or eliminates the government subsidized rebates.

This is how Vito would do it.

Regardless, demand is still &gt;&gt;&gt; than supply and it's February 22.

With that being said, orders are into September on many finished steel goods.

Sorry for the long-winded, DD, but I believe we were early, by about two months.

However, once we get clarity on Chinese export rebates, likely by March 8th, we could see our timeline readjust and prices get us back on track very quickly for the stocks we are holding.

As of right now, futures look positive and maybe there is some selective bargain hunting in the NASDAQ after today's big sell-off.

I'm personally staying out of Tech until I see clear reversals and then it will be selective.

I'm going to continue to allocate 50-60% of my portfolio to cyclicals.

Have a good evening and see you in the trenches tomorrow.

# WEEKLY MET COAL WRAP: Asia met coal prices diverge in China,   ex-China markets

 

Asian metallurgical coal prices moved in differing directions in China and ex-China markets in the week ended Feb. 19, with offers lowered on an FOB Australian basis to entice demand, while the latest transaction concluded higher in China.

The Chinese domestic coke market saw thin activity post-holidays as most buyers were waiting on the sidelines. **Some market participants said the relative low inventory level observed across different steel mills would lead to steady demand for coke in the near term.**  
 

In the ex-China market, despite weakness observed for premium coking coals on an FOB Australia basis, **delivered prices to India moved up quickly due to the recent Panamax freight rally.**  Platts assessed met coal dry bulk Panamax freight between Australia-India at $22.50/mt Feb 19, up $6.80/mt on week.  
 

# India resumes rebar exports after 6-month hiatus with competitive prices

 

**India resumed rebar exports Feb. 18 after a six-month hiatus** as its prices prove competitive with supplies from other origins such as   Turkey and China, market sources said Feb. 19.  
 

Several deals were heard in Singapore and Hong Kong for sales by two major Indian rebar exporters, JSPL and JSW, to end-users on Feb. 18.  The deals were booked by traders before the Lunar New Year at $610/mt CFR Singapore theoretical weight for April shipment and sold to end-users as position   cargoes, market sources said.  
 

These were the first export trades from India since August 2020, according to S&amp;P Global Platts observations.  
 

“Currently Indian mills are bullish on prices. Chinese futures are also increasing,” a trader in India said, adding that JSW was not allocating more rebar for export after the deals and JSPL was striving for above $635/mt CFR Singapore.  
 

A mill source in India said domestic demand has been strong and domestic prices were high, equating to $635/mt in Mumbai, reducing interest in export sales.  
 

However, export prices for Indian rebar were currently lower than from origins such as Turkey and China at $645/mt CFR Singapore and $665/mt CFR Singapore, respectively.  
 

“I think they want to export the excess material so that they \[India mills\] don't have selling pressure in the domestic market,” a second India trader said.



# US rebar prices unchanged, import market muted

 

Domestic and import rebar prices were unchanged on Feb. 19, amid largely steady market conditions.  
 

On Feb. 19, Platts' weekly Southeast US rebar assessment was flat from the previous week at $775-$800/ton, while Platts’ weekly Midwest US rebar   assessment was unchanged at $780-$805/ton.  
 

While the market contended with transportation issues amid the winter weather conditions in some regions, market sources indicated unchanged domestic prices.  
 

**A Midwest distributor said there were “no new price adjustments” by the mills amid the firm outlook for March scrap pricing and lack of imports.**  
 

Midwest rebar prices were holding firm despite a weather-related slowdown in demand, said a Midwest mill source.  The source saw the tradable range at $790-$810/ton at the mill.  
 

Some sources noted lower pricing in the Northeast, but added mills in other regions remained firm on prices.  
 

A Midwest fabricator and Southern fabricator agreed prices were flat despite weather conditions impacting transportation and production at some mills.  
 

# Steel scrap market weighs impact of US winter storms

 

Scrap market participants on Feb. 19 were weighing the impact of winter storms that struck the Central US, as the weather earlier in the week disrupted steel and raw material production and transportation in much of the US.  
 

The freezing temperatures, ice and snowfall slowed raw material flows, hindered trucking and barge scrap transportation, and impacted steel production at several mills in the region, market sources said.  
 

""Down South, you know they're not used to this \[weather\], so trucks aren't moving, barges aren't moving,"" one supplier said. ""It's definitely going to affect the market.""  
 

Disruptions due to weather will have a bigger impact on scrap supply than steel production, another supplier said, with inbound flows heard to be off by 50% in some cases.  
 

""I know some yards were closed Monday and Tuesday for sure, along with several stamping plants down at least Monday and Tuesday,"" a Southern trader said.  Additionally, multiple mills were running at limited capacity throughout the region, he said.  
 

One supplier believed the impact to steel demand and difficulties on the raw material supply side are likely to even out.  
 

""Any steel production capacity taken out by the weather this month will just be offset by lack of scrap inbound,"" he said.  
 

With the cold temperatures expected to rise in the coming days, a mill buyer said he expected activity to pick up.  
 

""I think guys will be able to pick up the pace and catch up,"" he said.  
 

# Iron ore plays a critical role in decarbonizing steelmaking. What does greener steel mean for global iron ore markets? And what part will China play in driving change?  Global steel and iron experts weigh in. 

[https://www.fastmarkets.com/article/3974510/iron-ores-critical-role-in-decarbonizing-steelmaking](https://www.fastmarkets.com/article/3974510/iron-ores-critical-role-in-decarbonizing-steelmaking)

Steel producers have yet to shake their heavy reliance on primary iron ore, and coke, the big polluter. Most iron ore producers are still at the very early stages of formulating a decarbonization strategy. Today, low-carbon steel has a tiny share of global steel markets, and the energy-intensive steel industry produces more carbon than steel.   


We asked leading steel and iron ore experts how iron ore can help shape the future of steelmaking, what these changes might mean for global iron ore markets, and what role China will play. 

**The steel industry produces more carbon than steel. How will the industry respond to pressure to clean up production, and what does that mean for markets?** 

 As surprising as it may seem, the steel industry produces more carbon than steel. For every tonne of crude steel produced, there is almost twice as much carbon produced. The challenge in cutting carbon emissions for industry is that a third of its energy demand is for high-temperature heat and, so far, there are few mature alternatives to fossil fuels.

Merely improving existing integrated steelmaking methods will not be sufficient to cut emissions and meet climate goals. The question is, how can we get away from coke, the big polluter?  


The average integrated plant in Europe is close to 50 years old and this has increased the appetite for investing in emerging technologies. Some European steelmakers are now leading the development and commercialization of hydrogen-based DRI.  


There is simply not enough top quality iron ore or scrap to meet the high DRI quality criteria, so BF-BOF steelmaking, which relies on primary iron units and metallurgical coal, will continue to be the dominant processing route in steelmaking for some time.

*Miriam Falk, Senior Analyst* 

**Is the global iron ore industry fit for purpose?** 

  
To succeed in decarbonizing the global steelmaking industry there needs to be a greater recognition of how much the iron ore supply base needs to change. Vast volumes of existing production will need to be replaced by higher-grade supply, first to meaningfully reduce CO2 emissions from the prevailing BF/BOF technology, and later to meet the demands of a DRI sector at least an order of magnitude larger than it is today.  
   
Iron is not a rare element, but producing the right kinds of ore whilst also meeting increasingly stringent ESG standards is set to be a huge challenge over the coming decades. The per-tonne cost base will have to be significantly higher than the low double-digits we are accustomed to, though even greater price differentiation between product grades according to their emissions profile upon consumption should increasingly offset this. Unless more forward-thinking investments are made, ore supply will be a major rate-determining bottleneck in decarbonization ambitions.

*Peter Hannah, Index Manager*  
 

**China’s steelmaking sector is evolving quickly. How might this impact global iron demand?** 

  
China’s mammoth steelmaking industry will continue to evolve and change in the coming years, especially with the continued drive by the Chinese government to reduce carbon emissions and increase living standards for its citizens.   


For example, China is attempting to reduce its dependency on imported raw materials by instituting strict capacity replacement ratios for blast furnaces and encouraging more scrap-based electric-arc furnaces in its steelmaking industry. However, at the same time, it is heavily reliant on iron ore and coking coal as the key steelmaking raw materials.  


Another key development to watch will be its continual re-structuring of the major Chinese steelmakers, some of which are state-directed. This will create new bases of market power in the region.  


The changes in ferrous trade flows and commodity pricing will be interesting to watch across the entire supply chain as they react to the changing market environment.

Finally and update on Section 232 Tariffs

[https://thehill.com/opinion/international/539805-biden-administration-must-settle-unwinnable-wto-cases-over-steel-and](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/539805-biden-administration-must-settle-unwinnable-wto-cases-over-steel-and)

Given delays due to COVID-19, the WTO recently announced it doesn’t expect to rule in [these](https://insidetrade-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/trade/wto-dispute-panels-push-section-232-resolution-second-half-2021) cases, or in the [cases](https://insidetrade-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/trade/wto-reports-us-challenges-section-232-retaliation-delayed-2021) the U.S. filed in response, until the latter half of 2021. The Biden administration should use the extra time to negotiate out of this mess. 

More broadly, a Biden trade “reset” will have to [start](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/527032-on-day-1-bidens-trade-policy-should-focus-on-europe-not-asia-or-the) with the EU. Like other U.S. allies, the EU was stunned by Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, and his threats to employ Section 232 on their exports of autos. Biden needs to address the future of Section 232 to calm allies, and appease members of congress who have been busy drafting legislation to rein it in. 

As I have said before, I have a trade attorney that is active in Section 232 and Section 301 and the consensus is the tariffs will not go away in one fell swoop, if they go at all.  Biden has already held up the Aluminum Tariffs.

This will be a razor blade, tight-rope to walk, between US steel manufacturers and the desire of the Biden administration to normalize relations with our allies in Europe.

If the tariffs go, they will be in incremental decreases over time not to hurt the market.

It will be digestible and I believe it will be also contingent on the roll back of Chinese exports that come through Europe and find their way to the US.

The move, IMHO, is to garner support from the EU in addition to US pressure to ensure China reduces or eliminates the government subsidized rebates.

This is how Vito would do it.

Regardless, demand is still &gt;&gt;&gt; than supply and it's February 22.

With that being said, orders are into September on many finished steel goods.

Sorry for the long-winded, DD, but I believe we were early, by about two months.

However, once we get clarity on Chinese export rebates, likely by March 8th, we could see our timeline readjust and prices get us back on track very quickly for the stocks we are holding.

As of right now, futures look positive and maybe there is some selective bargain hunting in the NASDAQ after today's big sell-off.

I'm personally staying out of Tech until I see clear reversals and then it will be selective.

I'm going to continue to allocate 50-60% of my portfolio to cyclicals.

Have a good evening and see you in the trenches tomorrow.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

&gt;President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

&gt;“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

&gt;“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

&gt;Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

&gt;But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

&gt;“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

&gt;Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

&gt;Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

&gt;Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

&gt;“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

&gt;Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

&gt;Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

&gt;Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

&gt;“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

&gt;Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

&gt;In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

&gt;“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

&gt;Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

&gt;The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

&gt;He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

Then? **Deleted. No rule cited. No DM. No “tone it down.” Just gone.** Why?

Because I said what the markets won’t:

**The Fed blinked. China and Canada are holding the detonator. And the U.S. Treasury market—the holy grail of global finance—isn’t bulletproof anymore.**

**Let’s recap:**

* **Japan started quietly dumping Treasuries.** Data from Japan's Ministry of Finance indicates that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds in the week ending April 5, 2025, marking a significant shift in their investment behavior. [www.fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-kato-says-will-not-sell-us-treasury-holdings-just-from-standpoint-of-us-japan-relations-202504090051)

* **Japan, South Korea, and China began coordinating trade and financial policy.** Reports indicate that these nations have engaged in discussions to align their economic strategies in response to U.S. trade policies. [www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-ruling-camp-call-sales-tax-cut-yomiuri-reports-2025-04-10/)
* **Canada issued a $3.5B USD bond, signaled reserve repositioning, and quietly hinted at coordinated selling.** Mark Carney didn’t even have to raise his voice—just moved a piece on the board and let the pressure rise. [www.snopes.com/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/11/canada-mark-carney-treasurys-sell-off/)
* **Bond yields exploded. Liquidity evaporated.** The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since late 2023, signaling a significant drop in demand. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)
* **The Fed muttered, “we’ll stabilize markets if needed.”** This statement indicates the Federal Reserve's readiness to intervene in the markets to maintain stability amid the volatility.

All of this points to one thing:  
**This is no longer about interest rates or inflation. This is a trust war.**  
And trust—not tanks—is what backs the U.S. dollar.

**Here’s what I didn’t get to post:**

**The infrastructure broke.**  
The system cracked under the pressure.

According to [Risk.net](http://Risk.net), over $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries were traded per day during the height of the tariff fallout—double the average daily volume. [www.risk.net (Paywalled)](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7961376/treasury-selloff-challenges-back-office-systems)

FIS and Trading Technologies—core post-trade platforms used by major brokerages—experienced significant processing delays due to the unprecedented trade volumes.

This wasn’t Reddit lagging under upvotes. This was the **clearing layer of the bond market going offline.**

That’s the nightmare:  
A liquidity shock colliding with a back-office failure.  
It creates a bottleneck that spirals into **margin calls, repo freezes, counterparty chaos**, and then—  
*maybe*—an actual market halt.

And what happened right after?  
**A surprise tariff exemption.**

**Which brings me to the biggest tell of all: the walkback.**

Trump spent days imposing 125% tariffs. Then suddenly:

**He backs off. Quietly. Subtly. A pause. A delay. A face-saving half-reversal.**

[content.govdelivery.com](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55)

**Why?**  
Because **the bond market screamed.**  
Because **Japan’s selling worked.**  
Because **the Treasury floor buckled—and the White House blinked.**

That tariff exemption **validates everything**:

* If the tariffs were effective, there would be no need to flinch.
* If China, Japan, or others weren’t leveraging their holdings, there’d be no fear.
* If the Treasury market wasn’t exposed, the Fed wouldn’t have signaled intervention.

This was a **geopolitical stress test**—and the U.S. didn’t pass.  
It limped across the finish line.

**So what now?**

This is the **foundation** under your economy catching fire.  
And the Fed just checked the beams and heard them **hollow.**

If you missed the original post, I’ve reuploaded it onto my profile [An idiot's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMysteryCheese/comments/1jxxss9/the_fed_just_blinked_china_is_about_to_nuke_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1).

Addendum: Consumer Credit Collapse

As u/couchsurfinggonepro rightly highlighted, I still managed to leave out a key point: the high risk of credit default at the consumer level.

Despite the tribal noise in politics, here’s the truth:
Most people are financially exhausted.

COVID didn’t just disrupt—it indebted. And while the headlines talk about jobs and inflation, the only real debate in Washington was: who gets bailed out and how?

Trump’s “solution” is now playing out. And what it will unleash is:

-Mass unemployment

-Mortgage defaults

-Credit card delinquencies

-Student loan defaults

-Personal bankruptcies

There is a bubble in personal consumer debt

Addendum 2: Margin Calls and Domestic Liquidity Fragility

u/im_a_squishy_ai built on the analysis above, it’s not just foreign selling that's stressing the bond market—the domestic side is breaking too.

Margin calls started going out to hedge funds on the first Thursday and Friday of the selloff. These weren’t triggered by any deep fundamental devaluation of equities—they were triggered simply because valuations reverted to a historical norm.

&gt;Stocks fell to 15–20x forward earnings—which is textbook fair value. That’s not a crash. That’s a mean reversion.

And yet, it triggered margin calls.

That tells us something:
Hedge funds are so over-leveraged that even a return to normal valuations creates a liquidity crisis. There is no buffer. There is no margin for error. No resilience.

This means this is another bubble—plain and simple. A structurally fragile one.

As the real economy begins to absorb job losses, business failures, declining earnings, and reduced consumer demand—all natural consequences of the tariff and credit tightening cycle—those margin calls are going to accelerate.

The market has already shown its hand:

&gt;Just normalizing destabilizes it.

But we’re not heading for normal. We’re heading for a deterioration.
And that means the next wave of selling won’t be orderly—it’ll be forced. Liquidations. Defaults. Fire sales.

Addendum 3: The Commercial Real Estate Time Bomb

u/Pietes highlighted another structural fault line we need to talk about, commercial real estate—and specifically the overvaluation and fragility of REITs.

Most commercial real estate isn’t bought outright. It’s acquired using loan-like financing structures, often leveraged against stock-based collateral or a fragile web of interconnected property portfolios. It’s a Jenga tower of credit assumptions—and all it takes is one piece to wobble.

REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are the largest holders of both commercial and residential real estate in the U.S. They are heavily dependent on valuation stability and rental yield expectations—both of which are at risk in the current macro environment.

In a scenario of rising rates, job losses, and liquidity-driven asset fire sales, REITs become amplifiers of systemic risk.

If the market faces renewed margin calls, and REIT valuations slip even modestly, their leverage unwinds

If property vacancies rise from business closures or consumer retrenchment, their cash flows evaporate

And if broader financial players start selling REITs or their underlying mortgage-backed assets to meet liquidity demands, we’re looking at contagion across multiple sectors

In short: REITs are sitting on illiquid assets funded by borrowed optimism.
In a liquidity crunch, optimism is the first thing to vanish.

Addendum 4 : The Domestic Bank Run

As per u/Boobpocket on my original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/s/2LMdR3Z3AQ

The recent policy move to freeze immigrant bank accounts is a potential flashpoint—and one that could blindside the financial system.

If even a fraction of the 15+ million account holders rush to withdraw their funds in fear of asset seizure or financial isolation, it could trigger a silent bank run.

This isn’t a regional bank failure or a crypto contagion. This is distributed, fragmented, and unpredictable—across every major bank and financial institution in the country.

You’re talking about:

Mass withdrawals

Liquidity pressures

Forced reserve drawdowns

Potential failures of smaller or mid-tier institutions

And a surge in cash hoarding and offshore transfers that destabilizes confidence in retail banking itself

It doesn’t matter whether the policy gets enforced.
The fear alone, the signal it sends can do the damage.

Addendum 5: Trump Walks Back the Tariff Exemptions—Sort Of - 13th of April 

There’s not much meat to this one yet, but it’s worth noting:

Trump just called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's own tariff guidance update—the one that signaled a soft exemption for Chinese chip imports—“fake news” on Truth Social.

&gt; Yes, he’s calling his own administration’s federal directive fake.

Make of that what you will.
Is it a power struggle inside the executive? A tactic to confuse markets? Or just another moment of chaos-as-strategy?

Whatever it is, it reintroduces uncertainty into a market that has barely begun to stabilize.

Addendum 6: China Halts Exports of Rare Earth Minerals - 13th of April 

China just put the brakes on one of the most strategically vital trade flows in the modern economy: rare earth minerals and magnets.

&gt; “It will take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports... would resume,”
—Michael Silver, CEO of American Elements (via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html))


This move can be read two ways—and both are bad for the U.S.:
1. It’s a flex.
China is leveraging its chokehold on critical materials—used in everything from EVs to military hardware—to apply economic pressure in response to tariffs and bond hostility.

2. It’s a mirror.
China is reminding the world that they are the factory, the mine, and the magnet. This isn’t just retaliation. It’s a demonstration of structural leverage. They don’t need to escalate. They just need to remind everyone how replaceable the U.S. is in the supply chain, and how irreplaceable China remains.

Either way, this is a strategic maneuver, not a tantrum.
And it just added more fuel to an already burning trust crisis in the U.S. financial leadership.

Addendum 7: Subprime Auto Loans

u/ClicheCrime brings up the subprime auto loan industry, currently operating on borrowed time and collapsing collateral.

Car values are plummeting as supply chain normalization floods the used market.

Borrowers are underwater on high-interest loans, many with zero equity.

Defaults are climbing, repo rates are spiking, and entire ABS (asset-backed securities) chains are quietly fraying.

This is 2008 subprime mortgages, but on wheels and with no bailout narrative.

Cars aren’t just assets. They’re lifelines.
In much of the U.S., no car means no job. There’s no public transport net to catch these people.

So what happens when millions lose access to work, default, and spiral into personal insolvency?

No car, no job.
No job, no payments.
No payments, no stability.

Addendum 8: Foreign Pensions Begin Pullback from U.S. Equities - 14th of April 

On April 14, reports emerged that major Danish and Canadian pension funds are actively reassessing and, in some cases, reducing their investments in U.S. equities due to escalating geopolitical tensions and market instability.

- Denmark's PFA, the country's largest pension fund, has been reducing its overweight in equities over the past month, citing increasing uncertainty stemming from recent trade policies and market volatility .

- Canadian pension funds are also pausing new investments in U.S. private markets, expressing concerns over the current economic climate and policy unpredictability .


These moves are significant. Pension funds are typically long-term investors, and such shifts indicate a growing unease about the stability of U.S. markets. The potential ripple effects include:

Reduced foreign capital inflows into U.S. equities, potentially leading to decreased market liquidity.

Increased volatility as large institutional investors adjust their portfolios.

Pressure on asset valuations, particularly if the trend of divestment continues.


This development underscores the importance of monitoring institutional investment behaviors, as they can serve as early indicators of broader market sentiment shifts.

Addendum 9: Yellen Just Sounded the Alarm - 14th of April

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has now publicly acknowledged what this thread has been screaming for days:

&gt; “The selloff in Treasuries is very worrisome, especially in light of Trump’s tariff policies.”
—Yellen, via [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5247789-yellen-dollar-based-assets-trump-tariff-policies/)


The top financial officer in the United States just admitted the core pillar of American finance—its ability to sell debt—is under threat. Not due to inflation. Not due to organic rate shifts. But due to policy-induced trust collapse.

Yellen specifically pointed to:

Dollar-based assets losing appeal

Tariffs as a destabilizing force

The need to reassure foreign holders of U.S. debt


This is no longer a fringe take.
This is no longer speculative.
This is Treasury-confirmed systemic risk.

And if she’s going public with it, you can bet the internal data looks even worse.

Addendum 10: China Is Building New Export Markets - 14th of April 

On April 14, President Xi Jinping began a high-level tour of Southeast Asia, starting with Vietnam—formally aimed at ""regional cooperation,"" but practically a geoeconomic pivot away from U.S. dependency.

&gt; The visit, [planned for weeks](https://www.reuters.com/world/vietnam-host-china-eu-leaders-coming-weeks-amid-us-tariff-risks-sources-say-2025-04-02/) and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while [Vietnam is negotiating](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-vietnam-agree-launch-trade-deal-talks-tariffs-paused-2025-04-10/) a reduction of threatened [U.S. tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.”
—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-meet-vietnam-leaders-kick-off-southeast-asia-tour-amid-us-tariffs-2025-04-14/) 


This isn’t a courtesy call. It’s a strategic rerouting of export flow. And Vietnam, already a rising player in global manufacturing and trade logistics, is a perfect staging ground.

What this signals:

China is not bluffing. 

Other markets are eager to absorb what the U.S. is pushing away.

The old global order—U.S.-centered, dollar-settled—is being actively re-engineered.

China doesn’t need to match tariffs with tariffs. It just needs to build alternatives—and that’s exactly what it’s doing.

Addendum 11: The Fed’s Independence Is on the Chopping Block - 14th of April 

On April 14, it was confirmed that the White House will begin interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair—months ahead of schedule.

&gt; “The White House will start interviewing candidates for the next Fed Chair this fall.”
—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bessent-says-white-house-will-start-interviewing-candidates-next-fed-chair-this-2025-04-14/) 


Let’s not play coy: this isn’t just succession planning. It’s the next phase of institutional capture.

The Trump administration has made it clear—through both action and pattern—that it intends to fill the Fed with loyalists, not technocrats. Past appointments have been:

-Underqualified

-Short-lived

-Routinely replaced by deeper loyalists when they showed even a shred of autonomy


This isn’t about rates. It’s about control over monetary levers in a time of financial strain.

What this signals to the world:

-U.S. monetary policy is no longer independent

-Market signals may be overridden by political needs

-The one institution still holding credibility with global investors is now up for grabs (don't forget that foreign leaders can openly bring DJT through his crypto and golden visa schemes)

Expect international confidence in U.S. debt and the dollar to deteriorate further, not just because of market signals—but because the referee is being replaced by the player.

This isn’t just about inflation targeting or QT timelines.
This is about the collapse of central bank legitimacy in real time.

Addendum 12: U.S. Power Projection No Longer Feared - 16th of April 

In a rare and sobering admission, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed what many outside the Pentagon have only speculated: the U.S. military’s strategic dominance is no longer guaranteed. In an interview, Hegseth stated that China’s hypersonic missile arsenal is capable of sinking all ten U.S. aircraft carriers within twenty minutes of conflict. This directly challenges the very foundation of U.S. power projection, which has, for decades, relied on carrier strike groups to enforce diplomatic and economic influence across the globe.

Hegseth went further, admitting that the United States “loses to China in every war game” currently run by the Pentagon. He characterized China’s military buildup not as defensive, but as explicitly designed to destroy the United States in a direct conflict. The failure, he claimed, lies within the U.S. military-industrial bureaucracy itself—too slow, too politicized, and too bloated to compete with China's rapid and strategically coherent expansion.

This isn't just a military problem. The credibility of U.S. deterrence underwrites the credibility of the U.S. dollar, the safety of U.S. Treasuries, and the assumption of global economic stability. If the world no longer believes the U.S. can protect trade routes, enforce treaties, or credibly deter a peer conflict, then the financial architecture built atop that assumption begins to wobble.

What Yellen hinted at in her comments about declining confidence in dollar-based assets, Hegseth has now echoed in military terms: the U.S. is no longer seen as untouchable. The psychological moat that protected American hegemony is drying up in real time.

**21.5k upvotes. 4.8 million views. 3.3k comments. 7.5k shares. 4 awards.**  
Then? **Deleted. No rule cited. No DM. No “tone it down.” Just gone.** Why?

Because I said what the markets won’t:

**The Fed blinked. China and Canada are holding the detonator. And the U.S. Treasury market—the holy grail of global finance—isn’t bulletproof anymore.**

**Let’s recap:**

* **Japan started quietly dumping Treasuries.** Data from Japan's Ministry of Finance indicates that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds in the week ending April 5, 2025, marking a significant shift in their investment behavior. [www.fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-kato-says-will-not-sell-us-treasury-holdings-just-from-standpoint-of-us-japan-relations-202504090051)
* **China responded to tariffs by not escalating—a silence that screamed “we’re ready.”** China's measured response to the U.S. tariffs suggests strategic positioning rather than immediate retaliation. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)
* **Japan, South Korea, and China began coordinating trade and financial policy.** Reports indicate that these nations have engaged in discussions to align their economic strategies in response to U.S. trade policies. [www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-ruling-camp-call-sales-tax-cut-yomiuri-reports-2025-04-10/)
* **Canada issued a $3.5B USD bond, signaled reserve repositioning, and quietly hinted at coordinated selling.** Mark Carney didn’t even have to raise his voice—just moved a piece on the board and let the pressure rise. [www.snopes.com/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/11/canada-mark-carney-treasurys-sell-off/)
* **Bond yields exploded. Liquidity evaporated.** The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since late 2023, signaling a significant drop in demand. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)
* **The Fed muttered, “we’ll stabilize markets if needed.”** This statement indicates the Federal Reserve's readiness to intervene in the markets to maintain stability amid the volatility. [www.theaustralian.com.au](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/how-the-bond-market-scared-trump-into-action/news-story/6b1db0612fbd5cfcbbc1cb5e313d1ecc)

All of this points to one thing:  
**This is no longer about interest rates or inflation. This is a trust war.**  
And trust—not tanks—is what backs the U.S. dollar.

**Here’s what I didn’t get to post:**

**The infrastructure broke.**  
The system cracked under the pressure.

According to [Risk.net](http://Risk.net), over $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries were traded per day during the height of the tariff fallout—double the average daily volume. [www.risk.net (Paywalled)](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7961376/treasury-selloff-challenges-back-office-systems)

FIS and Trading Technologies—core post-trade platforms used by major brokerages—experienced significant processing delays due to the unprecedented trade volumes.

This wasn’t Reddit lagging under upvotes. This was the **clearing layer of the bond market going offline.**

That’s the nightmare:  
A liquidity shock colliding with a back-office failure.  
It creates a bottleneck that spirals into **margin calls, repo freezes, counterparty chaos**, and then—  
*maybe*—an actual market halt.

And what happened right after?  
**A surprise tariff exemption.**

**Which brings me to the biggest tell of all: the walkback.**

Trump spent days imposing 125% tariffs. Then suddenly:

**He backs off. Quietly. Subtly. A pause. A delay. A face-saving half-reversal.**

[content.govdelivery.com](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55)

**Why?**  
Because **the bond market screamed.**  
Because **Japan’s selling worked.**  
Because **the Treasury floor buckled—and the White House blinked.**

That tariff exemption **validates everything**:

* If the tariffs were effective, there would be no need to flinch.
* If China, Japan, or others weren’t leveraging their holdings, there’d be no fear.
* If the Treasury market wasn’t exposed, the Fed wouldn’t have signaled intervention.

This was a **geopolitical stress test**—and the U.S. didn’t pass.  
It limped across the finish line.

**So what now?**

This is the **foundation** under your economy catching fire.  
And the Fed just checked the beams and heard them **hollow.**

If you missed the original post, I’ve reuploaded it onto my profile [An idiot's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMysteryCheese/comments/1jxxss9/the_fed_just_blinked_china_is_about_to_nuke_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1).

Addendum 8: Foreign Pensions Begin Pullback from U.S. Equities - 14th of April

Addendum 9: Yellen Just Sounded the Alarm - 14th of April

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has now publicly acknowledged what this thread has been screaming for days:

&gt; “The selloff in Treasuries is very worrisome, especially in light of Trump’s tariff policies.”
—Yellen, via [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5247789-yellen-dollar-based-assets-trump-tariff-policies/)


The top financial officer in the United States just admitted the core pillar of American finance—its ability to sell debt—is under threat. Not due to inflation. Not due to organic rate shifts. But due to policy-induced trust collapse.

Yellen specifically pointed to:

Dollar-based assets losing appeal

Tariffs as a destabilizing force

The need to reassure foreign holders of U.S. debt


This is no longer a fringe take.
This is no longer speculative.
This is Treasury-confirmed systemic risk.

And if she’s going public with it, you can bet the internal data looks even worse.

Addendum 10: China Is Building New Export Markets - 14th of April 

On April 14, President Xi Jinping began a high-level tour of Southeast Asia, starting with Vietnam—formally aimed at ""regional cooperation,"" but practically a geoeconomic pivot away from U.S. dependency.

&gt; The visit, [planned for weeks](https://www.reuters.com/world/vietnam-host-china-eu-leaders-coming-weeks-amid-us-tariff-risks-sources-say-2025-04-02/) and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while [Vietnam is negotiating](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-vietnam-agree-launch-trade-deal-talks-tariffs-paused-2025-04-10/) a reduction of threatened [U.S. tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.”
—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-meet-vietnam-leaders-kick-off-southeast-asia-tour-amid-us-tariffs-2025-04-14/) 


This isn’t a courtesy call. It’s a strategic rerouting of export flow. And Vietnam, already a rising player in global manufacturing and trade logistics, is a perfect staging ground.

What this signals:

China is not bluffing. 

Other markets are eager to absorb what the U.S. is pushing away.

The old global order—U.S.-centered, dollar-settled—is being actively re-engineered.

China doesn’t need to match tariffs with tariffs. It just needs to build alternatives—and that’s exactly what it’s doing.

Addendum 11: The Fed’s Independence Is on the Chopping Block - 14th of April 

On April 14, it was confirmed that the White House will begin interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair—months ahead of schedule.

&gt; “The White House will start interviewing candidates for the next Fed Chair this fall.”
—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bessent-says-white-house-will-start-interviewing-candidates-next-fed-chair-this-2025-04-14/) 


Let’s not play coy: this isn’t just succession planning. It’s the next phase of institutional capture.

The Trump administration has made it clear—through both action and pattern—that it intends to fill the Fed with loyalists, not technocrats. Past appointments have been:

-Underqualified

-Short-lived

-Routinely replaced by deeper loyalists when they showed even a shred of autonomy


This isn’t about rates. It’s about control over monetary levers in a time of financial strain.

What this signals to the world:

-U.S. monetary policy is no longer independent

-Market signals may be overridden by political needs

-The one institution still holding credibility with global investors is now up for grabs (don't forget that foreign leaders can openly bring DJT through his crypto and golden visa schemes)

Expect international confidence in U.S. debt and the dollar to deteriorate further, not just because of market signals—but because the referee is being replaced by the player.

This isn’t just about inflation targeting or QT timelines.
This is about the collapse of central bank legitimacy in real time.

Addendum 12: U.S. Power Projection No Longer Feared - 16th of April 

In a rare and sobering admission, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed what many outside the Pentagon have only speculated: the U.S. military’s strategic dominance is no longer guaranteed. In an interview, Hegseth stated that China’s hypersonic missile arsenal is capable of sinking all ten U.S. aircraft carriers within twenty minutes of conflict. This directly challenges the very foundation of U.S. power projection, which has, for decades, relied on carrier strike groups to enforce diplomatic and economic influence across the globe.

Hegseth went further, admitting that the United States “loses to China in every war game” currently run by the Pentagon. He characterized China’s military buildup not as defensive, but as explicitly designed to destroy the United States in a direct conflict. The failure, he claimed, lies within the U.S. military-industrial bureaucracy itself—too slow, too politicized, and too bloated to compete with China's rapid and strategically coherent expansion.

This isn't just a military problem. The credibility of U.S. deterrence underwrites the credibility of the U.S. dollar, the safety of U.S. Treasuries, and the assumption of global economic stability. If the world no longer believes the U.S. can protect trade routes, enforce treaties, or credibly deter a peer conflict, then the financial architecture built atop that assumption begins to wobble.

What Yellen hinted at in her comments about declining confidence in dollar-based assets, Hegseth has now echoed in military terms: the U.S. is no longer seen as untouchable. The psychological moat that protected American hegemony is drying up in real time.

This is my final update. There are too many signals, too much news, and I simply can't keep up. Everything I am seeing reinforces my analysis, and it has gone on to become a mainstream talking point. 

I appreciate the awards, updoots, and comments. I highly encourage people to start watching the news extremely closely over the coming weeks and / or months.

I'll still be in the comments, so if there is something you think I missed, please feel free to post it.

2025-07-08,2025-07-08 04:30:08,Reddit,search_result,shopify,"This Week's Top E-commerce News Stories 💥 July 7th, 2025","Hi r/Shopify - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter, which I've published weekly since 2021.

I was invited by the Mods of this subreddit to share my weekly e-commerce news recaps (ie: shorter versions of my full editions) to r/Shopify. Although my news recaps aren't strictly about Shopify (some weeks Shopify is covered more than others), I hope they bring value to your business no matter what platform you're on.

Let's dive into this week's top stories...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.
___
In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""
___
**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

PS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","This Week's Top E-commerce News Stories 💥 July 7th, 2025 Hi r/Shopify - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter, which I've published weekly since 2021.

OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.

In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""

**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir.

**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

Editor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter

PS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of July 7th, 2025 Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.
___
In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""
___
**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments.

The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers.

___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.

The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.

Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.

Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!

Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.
___
In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""
___
**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___

**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.

2025-07-12,2025-07-12 07:58:48,Reddit,search_result,antiwork,The “Big Beautiful Bill”: What It Means for Workers in the US and Worldwide,"On July 4, 2025, as Americans celebrated Independence Day, President Trump signed into law a massive 900-page package cynically nicknamed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (often just called the Big Beautiful Bill or BBB). Despite Trump hailing it as “the most popular bill ever signed” ￼, this legislation narrowly squeaked through Congress on party-line votes and polls show a majority of Americans opposed it ￼. Far from being universally “beautiful,” the new law represents one of the most consequential (and controversial) economic overhauls in a generation – overwhelmingly favoring the wealthy and powerful at the expense of ordinary workers. Below, we break down what’s in this bill, how it will affect workers in the U.S. and around the world, and why its promises of prosperity and deficit reduction ring hollow.


Key Provisions of the Big Beautiful Bill (and Who Wins or Loses)

At its core, the Big Beautiful Bill is a sweeping collection of tax cuts, spending priorities, and program cuts that form the backbone of Trump’s second-term agenda ￼. Here are some of the key provisions of the law and their likely impact on working people:

	•	Trillions in Tax Cuts (Mostly for the Wealthy): The law permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals, preventing their scheduled expiration and locking in ~$4.5 trillion in tax breaks over the next decade ￼. This includes making permanent the lower income-tax rates and brackets from Trump’s first term. It also adds a few temporary “goodies” – e.g. new tax deductions for tips, overtime pay, and auto loans – but these perks expire by 2028 ￼. There’s a modest $200 increase to the Child Tax Credit (from $2,000 to $2,200) ￼, yet millions of lower-income families won’t get the full benefit of that credit increase due to how it’s structured ￼. Meanwhile, the richest households come out way ahead: the top earners would see an extra $12,000 per year on average from these tax changes, whereas the poorest Americans would lose about $1,600 per year on average once the bill’s cuts to programs are accounted for ￼. In short, big winners are corporations and wealthy investors (with goodies like 100% immediate expensing of equipment purchases for businesses ￼ and tax hikes on university endowments instead of on billionaires ￼), while many working poor get only scraps or actually end up worse off.

	•	Cuts to Healthcare and Food Assistance: To partially “offset” the massive tax giveaways, the bill guts parts of the social safety net. It slashes Medicaid spending by roughly 12% ￼ and imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for many adults on Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps) up to age 65 ￼ ￼. (Even parents of children as young as 14 would be required to work to keep benefits ￼.) Over 71 million Americans rely on Medicaid and 40 million on SNAP, many of them the working poor. Most of these recipients are already working or cannot work (due to disability, caregiving, etc.), according to analysts – yet now they face extra hurdles and red tape ￼. The bill even allows states to charge $35 monthly co-pays to Medicaid patients ￼, effectively a punitive tax on being poor and sick. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that by 2034, these changes will cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured (losing Medicaid/health coverage) and 3 million more people to lose access to food stamps ￼. These are life-altering losses for millions of working families, sacrificed to finance tax breaks at the top.

	•	“Workfare” Ideology and Austerity: Republican architects of the bill claim they are “right-sizing” welfare programs to their original targets and rooting out “waste and fraud” ￼. In reality, this is classic austerity politics – kicking people off benefits by imposing strict conditions. Experts note that the vast majority of able-bodied adults on programs like SNAP already work; many others are students or caregivers, and almost all the rest are actively looking for jobs ￼. Imposing work requirements mainly throws vulnerable people off the rolls without improving employment prospects (as was seen in past state experiments). It’s effectively a cut to benefits by another name. Notably, by tightening eligibility and reducing benefits, the bill shifts costs downward: states will eventually have to shoulder a share of SNAP benefits cost if errors exceed certain rates ￼, and low-income individuals will bear higher out-of-pocket expenses (co-pays, lost assistance) – all while high-income earners enjoy permanent tax relief. This double standard is a hallmark of austerity measures, which we’ll revisit later.

	•	Massive Border &amp; Immigration Crackdown: The Big Beautiful Bill isn’t just about taxes – it includes roughly $350 billion for an immigration enforcement blitz ￼. This allocates $170+ billion for border security and immigration operations ￼, including nearly $47 billion to revive border wall construction ￼. It authorizes hiring 10,000 new ICE agents (with $10k signing bonuses) and adds tens of thousands of new detention beds to ramp up deportations ￼ ￼. Trump’s stated goal is to deport ~1 million people per year, the largest mass deportation effort in modern U.S. history ￼. To help pay for this, the law even slaps new fees on immigrants seeking asylum and other applications ￼. The administration is also moving to cancel legal protections for over a million immigrants – e.g. ending Temporary Protected Status and other humanitarian relief – to broaden the pool of people eligible for deportation ￼. In short, the bill supercharges the deportation machine at an unprecedented scale.

	•	Taxing Immigrants’ Remittances: In a move targeting immigrant workers and their families abroad, the law imposes a new 1% federal tax on remittances – money transfers that people in the U.S. send to family overseas ￼. (Originally lawmakers wanted 5% tax, but it was pared down to 1% in negotiations ￼.) This tax exempts transfers made via U.S. banks or credit cards, but cash transfers and money orders – common among unbanked, often low-wage immigrants – get hit with the fee ￼. The expected outcome is that less money will reach families in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the Philippines, etc., as workers either send less or resort to risky informal channels to avoid the tax ￼ ￼. The Center for Global Development estimates that Central America and Jamaica will be hit hardest, in terms of lost remittance income relative to their economies ￼. Remittances are a lifeline for many developing communities, often funding basics like food, housing, and education – siphoning 1% away (or driving the flow underground) directly hurts working-class families abroad and could even destabilize local economies reliant on those funds. Banks and fintech companies handling remittances also face new compliance burdens and potential losses as transfers decline ￼.

	•	Fossil Fuels Over Climate: The bill rolls back many clean energy incentives that had been enacted under President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and other green technologies are eliminated or slashed ￼ ￼. For example, a consumer tax credit for EV purchases that was supposed to run through 2032 will now expire at the end of this year (2025) ￼. Meanwhile, the law promotes fossil fuels: it expands tax credits for “critical minerals” needed in industry to explicitly include metallurgical coal (used in steelmaking) ￼, and it even repeals a tax on gun silencers (unrelated, but notably oil and firearms interests got their wishlists) ￼. The clean-energy rollback is so severe that one senator described it as a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries” and warned it will inevitably drive utility bills higher for consumers ￼. Globally, this U-turn on climate policy by the world’s largest economy is a blow to efforts to combat climate change. Heading into the international COP30 climate summit later this year, U.S. credibility on clean energy is undermined – potentially tempering other nations’ ambitions to cut fossil fuels ￼. Experts note that other world powers (like China) will likely seize the opportunity to fill the gap, by financing renewable projects abroad that the U.S. might have championed ￼. Sadly, the burden of climate fallout (extreme weather, resource pressures) often falls hardest on working-class communities worldwide – another indirect way this bill’s priorities could hurt ordinary people beyond U.S. borders.

	•	Defense Spending Surge and Miscellaneous Add-Ons: The Big Beautiful Bill isn’t austerity for everyone – the Pentagon gets a windfall. There’s $150 billion in new defense spending, including big allocations for warships, munitions, and even a pet project dubbed the “Golden Dome” missile defense system (with $25 billion earmarked for its development) ￼. Billions are authorized for NASA’s Artemis Moon Mission and Mars exploration ￼, and at the 11th hour lawmakers threw in $50 billion for rural hospitals (spread over five years) to placate holdouts worried about Medicaid cuts to rural healthcare ￼. Also slipped in: a $40 million fund for Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes” (essentially a statue park) ￼. In perhaps the most darkly ironic twist, the bill raises the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion ￼ – essentially acknowledging that massive borrowing will be needed to finance all these priorities. This last provision avoided a U.S. default, but it underscores the bill’s fiscal recklessness (more on that below).

This only scratches the surface – the law is hundreds of provisions long ￼ – but the pattern is clear. The BBB Act delivers generous benefits to the wealthy and to conservative interest groups (rich taxpayers, corporations, defense contractors, fossil fuel companies, nativists demanding border crackdowns), while ordinary workers, the poor, and vulnerable populations are left paying the price. As one analysis summarized, this law may constitute “the largest upward transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in American history.” ￼ Even the Congressional Budget Office – a nonpartisan scorekeeper – found the poorest will lose income on net, and millions will lose health coverage, while the law balloons the deficit ￼ ￼. Little wonder that multiple polls found most Americans opposed the bill and it had to be muscled through without a single vote to spare.



Impact on American Workers and Inequality

For working Americans, the Big Beautiful Bill’s immediate impacts are largely negative. To recap the most direct effects on workers in the U.S.:

	•	Millions stand to lose health care and food support: The new work requirements and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will strip away vital supports from people who are in low-paying jobs or between jobs. The CBO projects nearly 12 million more uninsured Americans by 2034 due to Medicaid cuts/work rules ￼. Losing health insurance obviously hurts workers’ health, financial stability, and bargaining power (it’s harder to leave a bad job if you risk losing healthcare). Likewise, 3 million will lose food assistance ￼ – in a country where hunger and food insecurity already plague many low-wage workers. These measures effectively punish the unemployed or under-employed for conditions often beyond their control (e.g. an older worker or one in a depressed region might not find 20 hours/week easily). Most people on these programs already work, and those who don’t typically face barriers like disability, caregiving, or lack of jobs ￼. So the real outcome is likely increased hardship, malnutrition, and stress for some of the poorest workers and their families – not a sudden boom in employment. It’s austerity under the guise of “personal responsibility.”

	•	Wage and job impacts: By pulling support away from workers, the bill could indirectly put downward pressure on wages. For instance, workers who lose SNAP or Medicaid may feel more desperate to take any job at any wage, which could undercut their ability to demand fair pay or better conditions. Furthermore, reduced consumer spending (as benefits are cut) can translate to job losses in local economies. It’s well-documented that programs like SNAP and Medicaid have a high “fiscal multiplier” – every dollar in benefits tends to generate more than a dollar in economic activity because low-income recipients spend it immediately on goods and services. Pulling that money out of communities can shrink demand and cost jobs. During the recovery from the Great Recession, for example, austerity measures (cuts to public spending) directly led to job losses and slower hiring. As the Economic Policy Institute noted, the idea that “drastic cuts to public budgets would somehow spur private-sector growth is a myth” – in reality, budget cuts have a “significant negative” impact on private-sector jobs and undermined recovery efforts in both the U.S. and Europe after 2010 ￼. By “saving” some government dollars, you often forfeit even more in private-sector economic activity. We could very well see a replay of that dynamic: the BBB’s cuts may reduce employment in healthcare, retail, and other sectors (especially in poorer regions) as federal support is withdrawn.

	•	Upward redistribution and inequality: The bill starkly magnifies inequality. To reiterate, the wealthiest households see a financial boost (via tax cuts), while the poorest see a net loss ￼. The top 0.1% of earners, high-income business owners, and investors effectively get tax relief funded by cutting benefits for the working poor. This is a one-two punch for inequality: post-tax incomes rise at the top and fall at the bottom. The law also tilts the playing field on the job market – for example, by repealing incentives for green industries while rewarding oil and gas, it could stifle growth in high-paying clean energy jobs that many blue-collar workers could have filled, instead channeling investment to fossil fuel projects that are often capital-intensive (and climate-deadly) rather than labor-intensive. Moreover, by supercharging deportations and taxing remittances, the law hits immigrant workers – who are a significant part of the labor force in agriculture, construction, service industries – with new burdens and fear. An undocumented worker now faces even higher risk of detention and family separation, which is not only a human tragedy but also pushes these workers further into the shadows, ripe for exploitation by bad employers (since speaking up about wage theft or unsafe conditions could get them deported). Documented immigrant workers sending money abroad will effectively earn 1% less on those dollars, or have to navigate around formal channels. All these factors weaken labor’s power and bargaining position relative to capital.

	•	“Workforce” vs. Workers: The philosophy behind many of these provisions is that if you make life without a formal job miserable enough, people will be forced to take low-paying jobs, thus bolstering the “workforce participation” stats. But treating workers as a commodity rather than as human beings with basic needs is a flawed approach. The U.S. already has one of the weakest social safety nets among developed nations; this law weakens it further. By making survival (healthcare, food) contingent on continuously working, and by not raising the minimum wage or strengthening labor rights in tandem, the policy essentially uses economic desperation as a cudgel. It’s likely to increase the number of “working poor” – people who are employed yet still can’t make ends meet, because pulling aid doesn’t magically raise their wages or lower their rent. In fact, in places like the UK, a decade of austerity after 2010 led to the longest period of wage stagnation in modern history – real wages in Britain stagnated since the late 2000s and had barely returned to 2005 levels even by 2023, despite sustained employment ￼. The quality of jobs and pay suffered. There’s every reason to fear a similar outcome here: low wage growth, precarious employment, and rising inequality as workers lose bargaining power and social supports.

In sum, for American workers the Big Beautiful Bill does little to improve daily life – there’s no boost to the minimum wage, no new worker rights, no major job program. Instead, it yanks away support from those who need it, showers gains on those who don’t, and banks on a disproven trickle-down logic that helping corporations and the rich will somehow benefit everyone (historical evidence shows it does not) ￼. The bill’s proponents promise it will spur growth and job creation, but similar policies in the past have produced subpar results for workers. Even the moderate economic expansion following the 2017 tax cuts was accompanied by continued wage inequality and rising deficits – and that was before the pandemic upheaval. Now, piling on more regressive cuts and austerity amid an uncertain economy could once again “shoot ourselves in the foot,” as EPI warned in 2012 ￼.


Global Ripple Effects on Workers and Economies

What happens in the United States – still the world’s largest economy – tends not to stay in the United States. The Big Beautiful Bill’s impact will reverberate across the globe, especially in regions closely tied to the U.S. Here are some of the major international ripple effects:

	•	Strain on Latin America (Deportations &amp; Social Strain): The U.S. is dramatically expanding its deportation pipeline, as noted above. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are bracing for an influx of deported migrants returning to communities that may not have jobs or support for them ￼ ￼. This bill also coincides with the shuttering of U.S. foreign aid programs like USAID that used to help Central American countries reintegrate deportees ￼. The result: poorer nations will have to absorb thousands of people suddenly uprooted from the U.S. each month, straining social services and local job markets. Central American countries are expected to be most affected ￼. This could fuel a vicious cycle – economic instability abroad often drives more desperate migration, not less. Moreover, if the U.S. is now taxing remittances and slashing aid on top of deporting workers, entire communities in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and beyond will lose significant income. For example, remittance flows make up over 20% of GDP in countries like El Salvador and Honduras; even a small drop can hurt local businesses and family livelihoods. Workers overseas who depended on that money will be forced to cut consumption, which in turn dampens economic growth in those countries.

	•	Geopolitical Shifts and Alliances: By aggressively tightening immigration and effectively taxing migrant workers, the U.S. is sending a message to its neighbors. Latin American experts warn that these policies will distance the U.S. from its allies in the hemisphere ￼ ￼. If migrants are treated harshly and their home countries get little support, governments in the region may seek partnerships elsewhere. Indeed, analysts note that China could step in to fill the void left by the U.S. retreat on clean energy and development assistance ￼. The BBB Act removed incentives for U.S. firms to build supply chains for critical minerals (like lithium) at home ￼, which could cede even more ground to Chinese companies in Latin America and Africa that dominate these sectors. In the long run, this means U.S. influence over global economic norms could wane, potentially affecting trade deals, labor standards, and worker rights internationally. A world where authoritarian powers have more sway is not one where labor rights typically flourish.

	•	Climate and Energy Repercussions: By rolling back green energy measures, the U.S. may slow the reduction of global greenhouse emissions, which hurts everyone in the long term (working-class communities are often least equipped to handle climate disasters). In the short term, U.S. pullback from renewables might depress investment or raise costs in the clean energy supply chain globally. However, many countries remain committed to the energy transition for economic reasons – renewable energy is becoming cost-competitive. Europe, China, and others will likely continue expanding wind, solar, EVs, etc., but perhaps with less U.S. partnership. As noted, world leaders heading to COP30 might scale back their ambitions if the U.S. is seen backpedaling ￼. Still, necessity and economics mean the renewables boom will continue elsewhere, just “with different partners” ￼. Workers in industries like solar panel manufacturing or electric cars in the U.S. might suffer from the loss of tax credits (jobs possibly shifting overseas), while oil and coal workers get a temporary reprieve. Globally, clean tech jobs might shift more to Asia/Europe, and the U.S. could lose its competitive edge in these booming sectors, affecting American workers’ future opportunities in high-growth industries.

	•	Global Financial Impact – Debt and Interest Rates: The Big Beautiful Bill is, ironically, a deficit-exploding bill. The CBO calculates it will add roughly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years ￼ (and that’s after accounting for any economic growth effects). This massive borrowing could have global financial repercussions. Increased U.S. deficits, especially if accompanied by tight labor markets, might lead to higher interest rates as the government issues more debt. Higher U.S. interest rates often pull capital from emerging markets (investors chase higher yields in U.S. bonds), which can weaken currencies and raise borrowing costs abroad. Countries with a lot of dollar-denominated debt could feel pressure. Moreover, if the BBB’s policies end up weakening the U.S. economy in the long run, that’s bad news for trading partners. America’s Quarterly points out that with the U.S. incurring significant new debt at a time of global economic fragility, the bill is likely to “weaken the U.S. economy and negatively impact the economies” of its regional partners ￼. Less U.S. demand for imports or less tourism/outbound investment would hit other economies. “Geography is destiny,” the analysts write – neighboring countries especially may find their fortunes dragging if the giant next door stumbles ￼.

	•	Example – Canada and Others: Even close allies like Canada are not spared from side-effects. Canadian businesses operating in the U.S. will need to navigate the new tax rules (e.g. changes to depreciation rules, cross-border tax provisions) ￼ ￼. If U.S. consumers have less disposable income (some will, due to lost benefits), Canadian exporters could feel a pinch in reduced U.S. demand. Conversely, some Canadian industries might benefit from U.S. policy shifts – for instance, if the U.S. cuts back on clean energy investments, Canadian firms might step in to supply or develop projects in North America. But broadly, when the U.S. embraces beggar-thy-neighbor policies (like taxing remittances and raising tariffs, as Trump’s agenda also includes tariffs), it can trigger retaliation or copycat measures that fragment the global economy, leaving workers everywhere worse off. The bill already killed U.S. plans to tax foreign digital services (a contentious issue with Europe) ￼, which avoided a trade fight for now, but it reflects a posture of economic nationalism that can spill over.

In essence, the world’s workers are connected. When American policy funnels more wealth to the top and squeezes the bottom, that exacerbates the global trend of inequality. Migrant laborers, whether in the U.S. or returning home, face greater precarity. Developing economies lose capital inflows and potentially human capital (if deported en masse). And by fueling deficit and debt with handouts to the rich, the U.S. may create instability that resonates through exchange rates, trade, and growth far beyond its borders.


Austerity Measures: History Strikes Back

One striking aspect of the Big Beautiful Bill is how it combines regressive tax cuts with strict austerity measures (targeted cuts to social spending) – essentially Robin Hood in reverse. This approach isn’t new; it echoes past policy experiments whose outcomes are well-documented. History shows that austerity hurts workers and rarely delivers the promised economic benefits. Let’s unpack that:

	•	What “Austerity” Means for Workers: Austerity in government policy usually means slashing public spending, social programs, and investments in the name of fiscal discipline. In practice, these cuts often hit public-sector employment, healthcare, education, pensions, and welfare programs – all of which directly affect working-class living standards. For example, if a government cuts school funding, teachers and staff lose jobs (or pay), class sizes grow (hurting education quality for the next generation of workers), and parents might have to pay more out of pocket. If it trims unemployment benefits or food assistance, unemployed or underpaid workers are forced to scrape by on even less. If it freezes public-sector wages or hiring, millions of workers see stagnating incomes (which can drag down wage growth in the private sector too). In short, austerity often means jobs lost, wages suppressed, and services degraded for the average person.

	•	The False Promise of “Expansionary” Austerity: Proponents of austerity often claim that cutting government spending will boost private-sector confidence, leading businesses to invest and economies to grow – effectively “expanding” out of recession. But this theory has repeatedly failed in the real world. A glaring example: after the 2008 financial crisis, many European countries (and some U.S. states) adopted austerity budgets. The result was not miraculous growth, but rather higher unemployment and slower recoveries compared to countries that pursued stimulus. By 2013, even the International Monetary Fund admitted it underestimated how badly austerity would damage growth and jobs ￼. In the U.S., from 2010–2012, cuts at the federal, state, and local levels caused hundreds of thousands of public-sector layoffs – which in turn dragged down overall job growth despite private-sector gains￼. In fact, every major industry except government was adding jobs in that period, meaning austerity in government was a sole driver of continued job losses in many states ￼. For example, states like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon saw 100% of net job losses coming from government cuts, not private declines ￼. Rather than unleashing the private sector, cutting public budgets shrunk the total pie. EPI analysts calculated that for every $1 cut from public spending, more than $0.50 of economic activity is lost from the private sector – a significant negative multiplier ￼. The promised efficiency or confidence boost never materialized; instead, we essentially “shot ourselves in the foot” by needlessly stalling job growth ￼.

	•	Workers Pay the Price, Not Debts: The ostensible goal of austerity is to reduce government deficits and debt. But paradoxically, harsh austerity often fails even on its own terms – it may not actually fix the debt problem, and can even worsen it. The reason: slashing spending in a weak economy can cause GDP to stagnate or contract, which means debt as a share of the economy can rise even if absolute deficits shrink. Research by economists Antonio Fatás and Lawrence Summers (2017) found strong evidence of such self-defeating fiscal consolidations. They concluded that attempts to reduce public debt via rapid austerity “have very likely resulted in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio” in the long run because of the negative impact on economic output ￼. In plainer terms, when governments cut spending too fast, the economy slows, tax revenues fall, unemployment payments rise, and the hoped-for deficit reduction either doesn’t happen or is short-lived. We saw this in Greece: despite draconian budget cuts and austerity from 2010 onward, Greece’s debt-to-GDP actually ballooned because the economy collapsed by 25%, and unemployment spiked above 25%. The human cost – depression-level joblessness, wage collapse, public health crises – was enormous, and the debt situation still deteriorated. The UK, after years of cuts, saw debt as a share of GDP fall only once growth returned (and even then, public debt in 2019 was higher than pre-austerity). As one British economic analysis pointed out 14 years after the 2010 austerity push: government debt had increased from 65% to 98% of GDP, while the country suffered the worst wage growth period since the Napoleonic wars ￼. So much for “fiscal responsibility.” Big deficit cuts are a lie in the sense that they promise prosperity and stability, but have never proven to work as advertised – instead they often shrink the economy and hurt workers without solving the underlying fiscal issues.

	•	Today’s Bill, Yesterday’s Mistakes: The Big Beautiful Bill fits this pattern to a T. It pairs enormous tax cuts (which drive up deficits) with selective austerity (cuts to programs for the poor) and imagines the outcome will be magically positive. Republican leaders even claim the law will reduce the deficit – but only by using an accounting gimmick that pretends the tax cuts don’t count as new costs ￼. Under a normal baseline, the CBO says the law adds $3.3 trillion to deficits in the next decade ￼. GOP senators, however, argued that since the tax cuts were “already policy” (set to expire, but they assume extension as baseline), we should ignore their cost; by that logic, they misleadingly claim a $500 billion deficit reduction ￼. It’s the kind of “magic math” that one watchdog said “would make Enron executives blush.” ￼ (The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – typically hawkish on deficits – sided with Democrats in calling out this sham accounting ￼.) In other words, the bill’s own numbers are a shell game. It’s marketed as fiscally responsible, but in reality it’s a huge deficit increase coupled with cruel cuts. History suggests this won’t spur exceptional growth; more likely it will set the stage for future cries of “oh no, the deficit!” which then become excuses for even more cuts to social programs down the line. It’s a cynical cycle: run up the deficit with tax cuts for the rich, then later demand austerity on everyone else to “fix” it. We’ve seen this movie before, and it ends with greater inequality and economic pain for workers.

	•	Who Really Benefits: So if austerity doesn’t fix deficits or grow the economy for all, what is it truly about? In blunt terms, it’s about power and class interests. The Big Beautiful Bill’s austerity measures reflect an ideology that government shouldn’t help people too much; that working folks should “pull themselves up” even as the rich enjoy government-engineered windfalls. The result is upward redistribution – the wealthy get tax relief, corporations get deregulation or subsidies, the military-security complex gets massive funding (which does create some jobs, but also enriches contractors), while the working class gets discipline and “incentives” to accept low wages (under threat of losing basic aid). This is by design: notice that when it comes to corporations or the Pentagon, there’s no penny-pinching – it’s only when it comes to social programs that fiscal discipline is invoked. This is why r/antiwork and many economists alike call out austerity as a scam: it’s sold as responsible budgeting, but functions as class warfare. As evidence, consider: if the true priority were deficit reduction, lawmakers could have let the 2017 tax cuts expire on schedule (bringing in more revenue) or trimmed military bloat or closed billionaire tax loopholes. They chose not to. Instead, they extended and deepened policies that increase the deficit and then targeted the poor to take the hit. It’s hard not to label that a con – one that workers have seen time and again.


Conclusion: A Hard Road Ahead for Workers

Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” may have a rosy name, but its outcomes look ugly for workers. In the United States, it widens the gap between rich and poor, threatens to strip healthcare and food from millions, and doubles down on a trickle-down fantasy that giving more money to the wealthy and corporations will somehow lift everyone up (a notion history soundly refutes). Internationally, it exports instability: immigrant families are put in peril, poorer nations lose out on vital income, and global efforts to address climate change are undercut. All this is being done in the name of “making America great” and “fiscal responsibility,” yet the law’s own projections show swelling deficits and public opposition. It’s a textbook case of political dishonesty – austerity for thee, but not for me – with working people bearing the brunt of the pain for the benefit of a privileged few.

The fight isn’t over. This bill will almost certainly face legal challenges, regulatory hurdles, and political backlash. There’s an election next year, and if public pressure is any indicator, many provisions (especially the most draconian ones on healthcare and immigration) will be hotly contested. Workers and their advocates will need to organize and speak out to protect what rights and support systems they have left. The lesson from this episode is clear: when you hear politicians insisting on huge cuts “for the sake of the deficit” or “to promote growth,” check the receipts. More often than not, those cuts are a one-way ticket to hardship for workers, and the promised growth never quite trickles down ￼ ￼.

Real prosperity isn’t achieved by taking from the poor to give to the rich; it’s achieved by empowering the broad base of workers – through fair wages, strong safety nets, healthcare, education, and the freedom to not be exploited or living paycheck to paycheck. The Big Beautiful Bill does the opposite. It may have passed, but it has also laid bare the priorities of those in power. And it’s a call to action for the rest of us to demand better – an economy that works for the many, not the few.

(Disclosure: I’ve been researching these issues extensively for an upcoming book on the cycles of collapse and its impact on us – those interested can find a preview of the first chapters via my Reddit profile.)","The “Big Beautiful Bill”: What It Means for Workers in the US and Worldwide On July 4, 2025, as Americans celebrated Independence Day, President Trump signed into law a massive 900-page package cynically nicknamed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (often just called the Big Beautiful Bill or BBB). Despite Trump hailing it as “the most popular bill ever signed” ￼, this legislation narrowly squeaked through Congress on party-line votes and polls show a majority of Americans opposed it ￼. Far from being universally “beautiful,” the new law represents one of the most consequential (and controversial) economic overhauls in a generation – overwhelmingly favoring the wealthy and powerful at the expense of ordinary workers. Below, we break down what’s in this bill, how it will affect workers in the U.S. and around the world, and why its promises of prosperity and deficit reduction ring hollow.


Key Provisions of the Big Beautiful Bill (and Who Wins or Loses)

At its core, the Big Beautiful Bill is a sweeping collection of tax cuts, spending priorities, and program cuts that form the backbone of Trump’s second-term agenda ￼. Here are some of the key provisions of the law and their likely impact on working people:

	•	Trillions in Tax Cuts (Mostly for the Wealthy): The law permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals, preventing their scheduled expiration and locking in ~$4.5 trillion in tax breaks over the next decade ￼. This includes making permanent the lower income-tax rates and brackets from Trump’s first term. It also adds a few temporary “goodies” – e.g. new tax deductions for tips, overtime pay, and auto loans – but these perks expire by 2028 ￼. There’s a modest $200 increase to the Child Tax Credit (from $2,000 to $2,200) ￼, yet millions of lower-income families won’t get the full benefit of that credit increase due to how it’s structured ￼. Meanwhile, the richest households come out way ahead: the top earners would see an extra $12,000 per year on average from these tax changes, whereas the poorest Americans would lose about $1,600 per year on average once the bill’s cuts to programs are accounted for ￼. In short, big winners are corporations and wealthy investors (with goodies like 100% immediate expensing of equipment purchases for businesses ￼ and tax hikes on university endowments instead of on billionaires ￼), while many working poor get only scraps or actually end up worse off.

	•	Cuts to Healthcare and Food Assistance: To partially “offset” the massive tax giveaways, the bill guts parts of the social safety net. It slashes Medicaid spending by roughly 12% ￼ and imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for many adults on Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps) up to age 65 ￼ ￼. (Even parents of children as young as 14 would be required to work to keep benefits ￼.) Over 71 million Americans rely on Medicaid and 40 million on SNAP, many of them the working poor. Most of these recipients are already working or cannot work (due to disability, caregiving, etc.), according to analysts – yet now they face extra hurdles and red tape ￼. The bill even allows states to charge $35 monthly co-pays to Medicaid patients ￼, effectively a punitive tax on being poor and sick. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that by 2034, these changes will cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured (losing Medicaid/health coverage) and 3 million more people to lose access to food stamps ￼. These are life-altering losses for millions of working families, sacrificed to finance tax breaks at the top.

	•	“Workfare” Ideology and Austerity: Republican architects of the bill claim they are “right-sizing” welfare programs to their original targets and rooting out “waste and fraud” ￼. In reality, this is classic austerity politics – kicking people off benefits by imposing strict conditions. Experts note that the vast majority of able-bodied adults on programs like SNAP already work; many others are students or caregivers, and almost all the rest are actively looking for jobs ￼. Imposing work requirements mainly throws vulnerable people off the rolls without improving employment prospects (as was seen in past state experiments). It’s effectively a cut to benefits by another name. Notably, by tightening eligibility and reducing benefits, the bill shifts costs downward: states will eventually have to shoulder a share of SNAP benefits cost if errors exceed certain rates ￼, and low-income individuals will bear higher out-of-pocket expenses (co-pays, lost assistance) – all while high-income earners enjoy permanent tax relief. This double standard is a hallmark of austerity measures, which we’ll revisit later.

	•	Massive Border &amp; Immigration Crackdown: The Big Beautiful Bill isn’t just about taxes – it includes roughly $350 billion for an immigration enforcement blitz ￼. This allocates $170+ billion for border security and immigration operations ￼, including nearly $47 billion to revive border wall construction ￼. It authorizes hiring 10,000 new ICE agents (with $10k signing bonuses) and adds tens of thousands of new detention beds to ramp up deportations ￼ ￼. Trump’s stated goal is to deport ~1 million people per year, the largest mass deportation effort in modern U.S. history ￼. To help pay for this, the law even slaps new fees on immigrants seeking asylum and other applications ￼. The administration is also moving to cancel legal protections for over a million immigrants – e.g. ending Temporary Protected Status and other humanitarian relief – to broaden the pool of people eligible for deportation ￼. In short, the bill supercharges the deportation machine at an unprecedented scale.

	•	Taxing Immigrants’ Remittances: In a move targeting immigrant workers and their families abroad, the law imposes a new 1% federal tax on remittances – money transfers that people in the U.S. send to family overseas ￼. (Originally lawmakers wanted 5% tax, but it was pared down to 1% in negotiations ￼.) This tax exempts transfers made via U.S. banks or credit cards, but cash transfers and money orders – common among unbanked, often low-wage immigrants – get hit with the fee ￼. The expected outcome is that less money will reach families in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the Philippines, etc., as workers either send less or resort to risky informal channels to avoid the tax ￼ ￼. The Center for Global Development estimates that Central America and Jamaica will be hit hardest, in terms of lost remittance income relative to their economies ￼. Remittances are a lifeline for many developing communities, often funding basics like food, housing, and education – siphoning 1% away (or driving the flow underground) directly hurts working-class families abroad and could even destabilize local economies reliant on those funds. Banks and fintech companies handling remittances also face new compliance burdens and potential losses as transfers decline ￼.

	•	Fossil Fuels Over Climate: The bill rolls back many clean energy incentives that had been enacted under President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and other green technologies are eliminated or slashed ￼ ￼. For example, a consumer tax credit for EV purchases that was supposed to run through 2032 will now expire at the end of this year (2025) ￼. Meanwhile, the law promotes fossil fuels: it expands tax credits for “critical minerals” needed in industry to explicitly include metallurgical coal (used in steelmaking) ￼, and it even repeals a tax on gun silencers (unrelated, but notably oil and firearms interests got their wishlists) ￼. The clean-energy rollback is so severe that one senator described it as a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries” and warned it will inevitably drive utility bills higher for consumers ￼. Globally, this U-turn on climate policy by the world’s largest economy is a blow to efforts to combat climate change. Heading into the international COP30 climate summit later this year, U.S. credibility on clean energy is undermined – potentially tempering other nations’ ambitions to cut fossil fuels ￼. Experts note that other world powers (like China) will likely seize the opportunity to fill the gap, by financing renewable projects abroad that the U.S. might have championed ￼. Sadly, the burden of climate fallout (extreme weather, resource pressures) often falls hardest on working-class communities worldwide – another indirect way this bill’s priorities could hurt ordinary people beyond U.S. borders.

	•	Defense Spending Surge and Miscellaneous Add-Ons: The Big Beautiful Bill isn’t austerity for everyone – the Pentagon gets a windfall. There’s $150 billion in new defense spending, including big allocations for warships, munitions, and even a pet project dubbed the “Golden Dome” missile defense system (with $25 billion earmarked for its development) ￼. Billions are authorized for NASA’s Artemis Moon Mission and Mars exploration ￼, and at the 11th hour lawmakers threw in $50 billion for rural hospitals (spread over five years) to placate holdouts worried about Medicaid cuts to rural healthcare ￼. Also slipped in: a $40 million fund for Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes” (essentially a statue park) ￼. In perhaps the most darkly ironic twist, the bill raises the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion ￼ – essentially acknowledging that massive borrowing will be needed to finance all these priorities. This last provision avoided a U.S. default, but it underscores the bill’s fiscal recklessness (more on that below).

This only scratches the surface – the law is hundreds of provisions long ￼ – but the pattern is clear. The BBB Act delivers generous benefits to the wealthy and to conservative interest groups (rich taxpayers, corporations, defense contractors, fossil fuel companies, nativists demanding border crackdowns), while ordinary workers, the poor, and vulnerable populations are left paying the price. As one analysis summarized, this law may constitute “the largest upward transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in American history.” ￼ Even the Congressional Budget Office – a nonpartisan scorekeeper – found the poorest will lose income on net, and millions will lose health coverage, while the law balloons the deficit ￼ ￼. Little wonder that multiple polls found most Americans opposed the bill and it had to be muscled through without a single vote to spare.



Impact on American Workers and Inequality

For working Americans, the Big Beautiful Bill’s immediate impacts are largely negative. To recap the most direct effects on workers in the U.S.:

	•	Millions stand to lose health care and food support: The new work requirements and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will strip away vital supports from people who are in low-paying jobs or between jobs. The CBO projects nearly 12 million more uninsured Americans by 2034 due to Medicaid cuts/work rules ￼. Losing health insurance obviously hurts workers’ health, financial stability, and bargaining power (it’s harder to leave a bad job if you risk losing healthcare). Likewise, 3 million will lose food assistance ￼ – in a country where hunger and food insecurity already plague many low-wage workers. These measures effectively punish the unemployed or under-employed for conditions often beyond their control (e.g. an older worker or one in a depressed region might not find 20 hours/week easily). Most people on these programs already work, and those who don’t typically face barriers like disability, caregiving, or lack of jobs ￼. So the real outcome is likely increased hardship, malnutrition, and stress for some of the poorest workers and their families – not a sudden boom in employment. It’s austerity under the guise of “personal responsibility.”

	•	Wage and job impacts: By pulling support away from workers, the bill could indirectly put downward pressure on wages. For instance, workers who lose SNAP or Medicaid may feel more desperate to take any job at any wage, which could undercut their ability to demand fair pay or better conditions. Furthermore, reduced consumer spending (as benefits are cut) can translate to job losses in local economies. It’s well-documented that programs like SNAP and Medicaid have a high “fiscal multiplier” – every dollar in benefits tends to generate more than a dollar in economic activity because low-income recipients spend it immediately on goods and services. Pulling that money out of communities can shrink demand and cost jobs. During the recovery from the Great Recession, for example, austerity measures (cuts to public spending) directly led to job losses and slower hiring. As the Economic Policy Institute noted, the idea that “drastic cuts to public budgets would somehow spur private-sector growth is a myth” – in reality, budget cuts have a “significant negative” impact on private-sector jobs and undermined recovery efforts in both the U.S. and Europe after 2010 ￼. By “saving” some government dollars, you often forfeit even more in private-sector economic activity. We could very well see a replay of that dynamic: the BBB’s cuts may reduce employment in healthcare, retail, and other sectors (especially in poorer regions) as federal support is withdrawn.

	•	Upward redistribution and inequality: The bill starkly magnifies inequality. To reiterate, the wealthiest households see a financial boost (via tax cuts), while the poorest see a net loss ￼. The top 0.1% of earners, high-income business owners, and investors effectively get tax relief funded by cutting benefits for the working poor. This is a one-two punch for inequality: post-tax incomes rise at the top and fall at the bottom. The law also tilts the playing field on the job market – for example, by repealing incentives for green industries while rewarding oil and gas, it could stifle growth in high-paying clean energy jobs that many blue-collar workers could have filled, instead channeling investment to fossil fuel projects that are often capital-intensive (and climate-deadly) rather than labor-intensive. Moreover, by supercharging deportations and taxing remittances, the law hits immigrant workers – who are a significant part of the labor force in agriculture, construction, service industries – with new burdens and fear. An undocumented worker now faces even higher risk of detention and family separation, which is not only a human tragedy but also pushes these workers further into the shadows, ripe for exploitation by bad employers (since speaking up about wage theft or unsafe conditions could get them deported). Documented immigrant workers sending money abroad will effectively earn 1% less on those dollars, or have to navigate around formal channels. All these factors weaken labor’s power and bargaining position relative to capital.

	•	“Workforce” vs. Workers: The philosophy behind many of these provisions is that if you make life without a formal job miserable enough, people will be forced to take low-paying jobs, thus bolstering the “workforce participation” stats. But treating workers as a commodity rather than as human beings with basic needs is a flawed approach. The U.S. already has one of the weakest social safety nets among developed nations; this law weakens it further. By making survival (healthcare, food) contingent on continuously working, and by not raising the minimum wage or strengthening labor rights in tandem, the policy essentially uses economic desperation as a cudgel. It’s likely to increase the number of “working poor” – people who are employed yet still can’t make ends meet, because pulling aid doesn’t magically raise their wages or lower their rent. In fact, in places like the UK, a decade of austerity after 2010 led to the longest period of wage stagnation in modern history – real wages in Britain stagnated since the late 2000s and had barely returned to 2005 levels even by 2023, despite sustained employment ￼. The quality of jobs and pay suffered. There’s every reason to fear a similar outcome here: low wage growth, precarious employment, and rising inequality as workers lose bargaining power and social supports.

In sum, for American workers the Big Beautiful Bill does little to improve daily life – there’s no boost to the minimum wage, no new worker rights, no major job program. Instead, it yanks away support from those who need it, showers gains on those who don’t, and banks on a disproven trickle-down logic that helping corporations and the rich will somehow benefit everyone (historical evidence shows it does not) ￼. The bill’s proponents promise it will spur growth and job creation, but similar policies in the past have produced subpar results for workers. Even the moderate economic expansion following the 2017 tax cuts was accompanied by continued wage inequality and rising deficits – and that was before the pandemic upheaval. Now, piling on more regressive cuts and austerity amid an uncertain economy could once again “shoot ourselves in the foot,” as EPI warned in 2012 ￼.


Global Ripple Effects on Workers and Economies

What happens in the United States – still the world’s largest economy – tends not to stay in the United States. The Big Beautiful Bill’s impact will reverberate across the globe, especially in regions closely tied to the U.S. Here are some of the major international ripple effects:

	•	Strain on Latin America (Deportations &amp; Social Strain): The U.S. is dramatically expanding its deportation pipeline, as noted above. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are bracing for an influx of deported migrants returning to communities that may not have jobs or support for them ￼ ￼. This bill also coincides with the shuttering of U.S. foreign aid programs like USAID that used to help Central American countries reintegrate deportees ￼. The result: poorer nations will have to absorb thousands of people suddenly uprooted from the U.S. each month, straining social services and local job markets. Central American countries are expected to be most affected ￼. This could fuel a vicious cycle – economic instability abroad often drives more desperate migration, not less. Moreover, if the U.S. is now taxing remittances and slashing aid on top of deporting workers, entire communities in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and beyond will lose significant income. For example, remittance flows make up over 20% of GDP in countries like El Salvador and Honduras; even a small drop can hurt local businesses and family livelihoods. Workers overseas who depended on that money will be forced to cut consumption, which in turn dampens economic growth in those countries.

	•	Geopolitical Shifts and Alliances: By aggressively tightening immigration and effectively taxing migrant workers, the U.S. is sending a message to its neighbors. Latin American experts warn that these policies will distance the U.S. from its allies in the hemisphere ￼ ￼. If migrants are treated harshly and their home countries get little support, governments in the region may seek partnerships elsewhere. Indeed, analysts note that China could step in to fill the void left by the U.S. retreat on clean energy and development assistance ￼. The BBB Act removed incentives for U.S. firms to build supply chains for critical minerals (like lithium) at home ￼, which could cede even more ground to Chinese companies in Latin America and Africa that dominate these sectors. In the long run, this means U.S. influence over global economic norms could wane, potentially affecting trade deals, labor standards, and worker rights internationally. A world where authoritarian powers have more sway is not one where labor rights typically flourish.

	•	Climate and Energy Repercussions: By rolling back green energy measures, the U.S. may slow the reduction of global greenhouse emissions, which hurts everyone in the long term (working-class communities are often least equipped to handle climate disasters). In the short term, U.S. pullback from renewables might depress investment or raise costs in the clean energy supply chain globally. However, many countries remain committed to the energy transition for economic reasons – renewable energy is becoming cost-competitive. Europe, China, and others will likely continue expanding wind, solar, EVs, etc., but perhaps with less U.S. partnership. As noted, world leaders heading to COP30 might scale back their ambitions if the U.S. is seen backpedaling ￼. Still, necessity and economics mean the renewables boom will continue elsewhere, just “with different partners” ￼. Workers in industries like solar panel manufacturing or electric cars in the U.S. might suffer from the loss of tax credits (jobs possibly shifting overseas), while oil and coal workers get a temporary reprieve. Globally, clean tech jobs might shift more to Asia/Europe, and the U.S. could lose its competitive edge in these booming sectors, affecting American workers’ future opportunities in high-growth industries.

	•	Global Financial Impact – Debt and Interest Rates: The Big Beautiful Bill is, ironically, a deficit-exploding bill. The CBO calculates it will add roughly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years ￼ (and that’s after accounting for any economic growth effects). This massive borrowing could have global financial repercussions. Increased U.S. deficits, especially if accompanied by tight labor markets, might lead to higher interest rates as the government issues more debt. Higher U.S. interest rates often pull capital from emerging markets (investors chase higher yields in U.S. bonds), which can weaken currencies and raise borrowing costs abroad. Countries with a lot of dollar-denominated debt could feel pressure. Moreover, if the BBB’s policies end up weakening the U.S. economy in the long run, that’s bad news for trading partners. America’s Quarterly points out that with the U.S. incurring significant new debt at a time of global economic fragility, the bill is likely to “weaken the U.S. economy and negatively impact the economies” of its regional partners ￼. Less U.S. demand for imports or less tourism/outbound investment would hit other economies. “Geography is destiny,” the analysts write – neighboring countries especially may find their fortunes dragging if the giant next door stumbles ￼.

	•	Example – Canada and Others: Even close allies like Canada are not spared from side-effects. Canadian businesses operating in the U.S. will need to navigate the new tax rules (e.g. changes to depreciation rules, cross-border tax provisions) ￼ ￼. If U.S. consumers have less disposable income (some will, due to lost benefits), Canadian exporters could feel a pinch in reduced U.S. demand. Conversely, some Canadian industries might benefit from U.S. policy shifts – for instance, if the U.S. cuts back on clean energy investments, Canadian firms might step in to supply or develop projects in North America. But broadly, when the U.S. embraces beggar-thy-neighbor policies (like taxing remittances and raising tariffs, as Trump’s agenda also includes tariffs), it can trigger retaliation or copycat measures that fragment the global economy, leaving workers everywhere worse off. The bill already killed U.S. plans to tax foreign digital services (a contentious issue with Europe) ￼, which avoided a trade fight for now, but it reflects a posture of economic nationalism that can spill over.

In essence, the world’s workers are connected. When American policy funnels more wealth to the top and squeezes the bottom, that exacerbates the global trend of inequality. Migrant laborers, whether in the U.S. or returning home, face greater precarity. Developing economies lose capital inflows and potentially human capital (if deported en masse). And by fueling deficit and debt with handouts to the rich, the U.S. may create instability that resonates through exchange rates, trade, and growth far beyond its borders.


Austerity Measures: History Strikes Back

One striking aspect of the Big Beautiful Bill is how it combines regressive tax cuts with strict austerity measures (targeted cuts to social spending) – essentially Robin Hood in reverse. This approach isn’t new; it echoes past policy experiments whose outcomes are well-documented. History shows that austerity hurts workers and rarely delivers the promised economic benefits. Let’s unpack that:

	•	What “Austerity” Means for Workers: Austerity in government policy usually means slashing public spending, social programs, and investments in the name of fiscal discipline. In practice, these cuts often hit public-sector employment, healthcare, education, pensions, and welfare programs – all of which directly affect working-class living standards. For example, if a government cuts school funding, teachers and staff lose jobs (or pay), class sizes grow (hurting education quality for the next generation of workers), and parents might have to pay more out of pocket. If it trims unemployment benefits or food assistance, unemployed or underpaid workers are forced to scrape by on even less. If it freezes public-sector wages or hiring, millions of workers see stagnating incomes (which can drag down wage growth in the private sector too). In short, austerity often means jobs lost, wages suppressed, and services degraded for the average person.

	•	The False Promise of “Expansionary” Austerity: Proponents of austerity often claim that cutting government spending will boost private-sector confidence, leading businesses to invest and economies to grow – effectively “expanding” out of recession. But this theory has repeatedly failed in the real world. A glaring example: after the 2008 financial crisis, many European countries (and some U.S. states) adopted austerity budgets. The result was not miraculous growth, but rather higher unemployment and slower recoveries compared to countries that pursued stimulus. By 2013, even the International Monetary Fund admitted it underestimated how badly austerity would damage growth and jobs ￼. In the U.S., from 2010–2012, cuts at the federal, state, and local levels caused hundreds of thousands of public-sector layoffs – which in turn dragged down overall job growth despite private-sector gains￼. In fact, every major industry except government was adding jobs in that period, meaning austerity in government was a sole driver of continued job losses in many states ￼. For example, states like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon saw 100% of net job losses coming from government cuts, not private declines ￼. Rather than unleashing the private sector, cutting public budgets shrunk the total pie. EPI analysts calculated that for every $1 cut from public spending, more than $0.50 of economic activity is lost from the private sector – a significant negative multiplier ￼. The promised efficiency or confidence boost never materialized; instead, we essentially “shot ourselves in the foot” by needlessly stalling job growth ￼.

	•	Workers Pay the Price, Not Debts: The ostensible goal of austerity is to reduce government deficits and debt. But paradoxically, harsh austerity often fails even on its own terms – it may not actually fix the debt problem, and can even worsen it. The reason: slashing spending in a weak economy can cause GDP to stagnate or contract, which means debt as a share of the economy can rise even if absolute deficits shrink. Research by economists Antonio Fatás and Lawrence Summers (2017) found strong evidence of such self-defeating fiscal consolidations. They concluded that attempts to reduce public debt via rapid austerity “have very likely resulted in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio” in the long run because of the negative impact on economic output ￼. In plainer terms, when governments cut spending too fast, the economy slows, tax revenues fall, unemployment payments rise, and the hoped-for deficit reduction either doesn’t happen or is short-lived. We saw this in Greece: despite draconian budget cuts and austerity from 2010 onward, Greece’s debt-to-GDP actually ballooned because the economy collapsed by 25%, and unemployment spiked above 25%. The human cost – depression-level joblessness, wage collapse, public health crises – was enormous, and the debt situation still deteriorated. The UK, after years of cuts, saw debt as a share of GDP fall only once growth returned (and even then, public debt in 2019 was higher than pre-austerity). As one British economic analysis pointed out 14 years after the 2010 austerity push: government debt had increased from 65% to 98% of GDP, while the country suffered the worst wage growth period since the Napoleonic wars ￼. So much for “fiscal responsibility.” Big deficit cuts are a lie in the sense that they promise prosperity and stability, but have never proven to work as advertised – instead they often shrink the economy and hurt workers without solving the underlying fiscal issues.

	•	Today’s Bill, Yesterday’s Mistakes: The Big Beautiful Bill fits this pattern to a T. It pairs enormous tax cuts (which drive up deficits) with selective austerity (cuts to programs for the poor) and imagines the outcome will be magically positive. Republican leaders even claim the law will reduce the deficit – but only by using an accounting gimmick that pretends the tax cuts don’t count as new costs ￼. Under a normal baseline, the CBO says the law adds $3.3 trillion to deficits in the next decade ￼. GOP senators, however, argued that since the tax cuts were “already policy” (set to expire, but they assume extension as baseline), we should ignore their cost; by that logic, they misleadingly claim a $500 billion deficit reduction ￼. It’s the kind of “magic math” that one watchdog said “would make Enron executives blush.” ￼ (The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – typically hawkish on deficits – sided with Democrats in calling out this sham accounting ￼.) In other words, the bill’s own numbers are a shell game. It’s marketed as fiscally responsible, but in reality it’s a huge deficit increase coupled with cruel cuts. History suggests this won’t spur exceptional growth; more likely it will set the stage for future cries of “oh no, the deficit!” which then become excuses for even more cuts to social programs down the line. It’s a cynical cycle: run up the deficit with tax cuts for the rich, then later demand austerity on everyone else to “fix” it. We’ve seen this movie before, and it ends with greater inequality and economic pain for workers.

	•	Who Really Benefits: So if austerity doesn’t fix deficits or grow the economy for all, what is it truly about? In blunt terms, it’s about power and class interests. The Big Beautiful Bill’s austerity measures reflect an ideology that government shouldn’t help people too much; that working folks should “pull themselves up” even as the rich enjoy government-engineered windfalls. The result is upward redistribution – the wealthy get tax relief, corporations get deregulation or subsidies, the military-security complex gets massive funding (which does create some jobs, but also enriches contractors), while the working class gets discipline and “incentives” to accept low wages (under threat of losing basic aid). This is by design: notice that when it comes to corporations or the Pentagon, there’s no penny-pinching – it’s only when it comes to social programs that fiscal discipline is invoked. This is why r/antiwork and many economists alike call out austerity as a scam: it’s sold as responsible budgeting, but functions as class warfare. As evidence, consider: if the true priority were deficit reduction, lawmakers could have let the 2017 tax cuts expire on schedule (bringing in more revenue) or trimmed military bloat or closed billionaire tax loopholes. They chose not to. Instead, they extended and deepened policies that increase the deficit and then targeted the poor to take the hit. It’s hard not to label that a con – one that workers have seen time and again.


Conclusion: A Hard Road Ahead for Workers

Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” may have a rosy name, but its outcomes look ugly for workers. In the United States, it widens the gap between rich and poor, threatens to strip healthcare and food from millions, and doubles down on a trickle-down fantasy that giving more money to the wealthy and corporations will somehow lift everyone up (a notion history soundly refutes). Internationally, it exports instability: immigrant families are put in peril, poorer nations lose out on vital income, and global efforts to address climate change are undercut. All this is being done in the name of “making America great” and “fiscal responsibility,” yet the law’s own projections show swelling deficits and public opposition. It’s a textbook case of political dishonesty – austerity for thee, but not for me – with working people bearing the brunt of the pain for the benefit of a privileged few.

The fight isn’t over. This bill will almost certainly face legal challenges, regulatory hurdles, and political backlash. There’s an election next year, and if public pressure is any indicator, many provisions (especially the most draconian ones on healthcare and immigration) will be hotly contested. Workers and their advocates will need to organize and speak out to protect what rights and support systems they have left. The lesson from this episode is clear: when you hear politicians insisting on huge cuts “for the sake of the deficit” or “to promote growth,” check the receipts. More often than not, those cuts are a one-way ticket to hardship for workers, and the promised growth never quite trickles down ￼ ￼.

Real prosperity isn’t achieved by taking from the poor to give to the rich; it’s achieved by empowering the broad base of workers – through fair wages, strong safety nets, healthcare, education, and the freedom to not be exploited or living paycheck to paycheck. The Big Beautiful Bill does the opposite. It may have passed, but it has also laid bare the priorities of those in power. And it’s a call to action for the rest of us to demand better – an economy that works for the many, not the few.

2025-04-23,2025-04-23 04:13:09,Reddit,search_result,stocks,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

2025-03-05,2025-03-05 22:17:54,Reddit,search_result,economicCollapse,The US economy is already dead... it just doesn't know it yet.,"Someone recommended this sub for a re-posting of my little prediction of doom. Enjoy, so far as you are able:

**To be specific: The US will go into acute stagflation inside of 4 months, which will then transition to a depression more severe than the 2008 crisis before the end of the year. And it's already unavoidable.**

We are seeing the building blocks of a disaster the likes of which we haven't seen in generations, and it's a question of when, not if it goes off the rails. 

**First, there's massive inflationary pressure right now:**

* Prices of imported goods have started to rise sharply because companies have to be prepared to weather tariff price spikes, if they actually happen or not
* International trade is no longer reliable, because the administration flip-flops on trade agreements daily, making goods less available
* Neighboring sources of vital construction materials are being antagonised while the country needs to rebuild after massive wildfires
* Agricultural output will be extremely unreliable due to... [*gestures broadly at everything*] but mostly deporting farm workers, bird flu and draining the california agricultural reservoirs

**Second, those same things can also trigger a recession and there's more:**

* The federal government is going to stop paying for things, basically at random. 20% of GDP is now unreliable.
* Crypto-bro tech-moguls are sniping at each other, presidents are hawking meme-coins, law enforcement is in the hands of partisan imbeciles and the SEC is about to be gutted. Fraud will run rampant. Noone knows if that will juice or tank the stock market, but it scares people
* Big Tech which contribues ~10% of US GDP directly has alligned itself with the government. Around the world but mostly in Europe boycots are forming. China releasing an AI competitor saw a 3% drop in the Nasdaq, with over half a trillion dollars wiped off of the valuation of one top stock. They are *fragile*, and particularly reliant on international suppliers like TSMC and ASML.
* It is entirely possible that the US will default on its debt, either by whim of its new rulers, or through gross incompetence of the hacker known as ~~4chan~~ BigBalls who has been put in charge of the treasury payment system. Something nearly impossible in normal circumstances could be ordered by the president, and be carried out before anyone realises what has happened. And then the dollar is over.

**Unemployment will be off the charts:**

* Tens of thousands of government workers are being (illegally) fired, and contractors dumped, aiming at up to a million unemployed - but that's just the start.
* Right now 30,000 are confirmed. But OPM has mandated firing 200,000 probationary employees hired just in the last year to be let go by september, and that's not even counting contractors. Federal agencies rely heavily on contract employees, so we can expect 2-3 contractors to lose their income per federal employee lost.
* That's the direct workers, but there's much more: when something like HUD is dismantled by cutting 84% of the ~8000 workers, that means it simply *cannot operate*. HUD administers programs like LIHTC and JPIP which support over 90.000 jobs annually, primarily small businesses.
* With USAID shut down by cutting 14.000 employees the spending *stops*; billions of dollars of that spending went to farms in the midwest that have lost their contracts, their livelyhoods. 80% of that 60 billion dollar USAID budget went to US firms - it was an indirect subsidy that secured hundreds of thousands of jobs.
* Then there's the hiring freezes all over - not just in the government but the affected programs like university-administered medical research.
* There's maybe two dozen people authorized to actually administer and pay out the 30 billion dollars per year that the IRA distributes, fire them and all that goes away. It's authorised, the money is there, it just doesn't get spent. That's a lot of jobs.
* This isn't even taking into account the people losing their jobs to the tariffs and further trade war insanity.

The ripple effects here are going to greatly disproportional to the first-order numbers.

Inflation is manageable. A recession is manageable. High unemployment is manageable. A failed harvest is manageable. A trade deal breaking up is manageable. A constitutional crisis is manageable. A supply chain disruption is manageable. A war is manageable. A reduction in government spending is manageable. A breakup of an alliance is manageable.

*But not all at once.*

If these trends all manage to hit, which they almost certainly will, we will be seeing a collapse of employment and industry combined with rising prices: classic 80's style stagflation. 

The inflation will be transitory - the prices will probably only go up initially as the tariffs are threatened, then imposed and trade starts to fail. After a short while of stockpiles depleting prices might go up a little more, but it would basically reach a new normal at a higher price point. Agriculture will recover, etc. Still, it's a good year or two of suck. In the mean time that inflation will paralyse the Fed: They'll want to lower rates to counter the recession, but bond markets would rebel because of the inflation. QE would be a possible response, but would also be seen as irresponsible with 'room to cut' being available and inflation already at a high point.

With the regime being too [redacted] to respond to the self-inflicted damage [things will turn nasty](https://youtu.be/68Dlb4B3m24?si=SFC7XrNTrhnuu84y&amp;t=138). With most adults in the room purged outright or sidelined, the recession will quickly transition to a [debt-deflation spiral](https://www.socialscience.international/hyman-minsky-financial-instability-hypothesis), and somewhere along the way the massive bubble in asset prices is going to pop and we'll see the 3rd [Minsky moment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minskymoment.asp) of the past century. That's when the **Greatest Depression** starts, folks.

Some believe that the regime's economic 'thinkers' (Bessent, Lutnick, Miran, Navarro) have explicitly planned to crush the economy as soon as possible so they can say it was ""biden’s economy"" that crashed; this would let them both profit off the collapse, and allow the president to swoop in and rescue the country. But be it malice or gross incompetence... such a rescue is not possible.

**Roadblocks to recovery:**

* The investments needed to re-shore and re-build the manufacturing capacity to compensate for supply that is being cut off internationally will not happen because expected returns are impossible to predict, and spending is already cratering
* Even if new factories are built - which would take years - to be profitable modern manufacturing is hyper-productive; it creates lots of product but almost no jobs. A few engineers and maintenance people can do the work of hundreds of manual labourers - there is no way to absorb the massive unemployment that's coming, and few able to afford the products.
* The last time the US was in stagflation was in the 1970s, it was ended with Volcker's Hammer - Paul Volcker, the head of the Fed, raised interest rates to 20%. This caused a severe recession which wrecked the economy and allowed a reset. The current leadership would not allow that. The president is pushing hard for interest rate cuts, and a head-on collision between the Federal Reserve and the office of the President will be intensely destructive to market confidence.
* Counteracting the collapsing stock market will require re-capitalisation by the Fed of various institutions that the regime *does not like*, and which its main economists would actively seek to prevent - by the time a 'healthy correction' had turned into a complete slaughter, the Fed will be powerless
* Recovery from any of these would be a difficult, long-term problem, maybe a decade or more. But the DOGE wrecking-ball is preventing anyone from even trying to recover or even maintain anything. They're gutting the federal government, firing everyone with the kind of institutional knowledge needed to staunch the bleeding or turn around a decline. At best there's going to be a survival situation, where they manage to salvage some of the nation's resources under their own control.

The modern world is filled with complexity that requires the admnistrative state, and despite claims to the contary it is not being made efficient... it is being systematically destroyed. 

The theory (such as it is) is that all government spending is inefficient, and 'crowds out' private enterprise. So if you get rid of the government, private enterprise will flourish. What actually happens is that aggregate demand plumets, and GDP gets wrecked. That's how when Greece cut 30% of government spening, it also lost 30% of its GDP. It hasn't recovered since 2010 and the US is now doing that to itself.

If I'm right, we'll see the first major shock come in on March 7th, when the febuary unemployment numbers come in. That won't be the worst of it, because there's a lot of inertia in 'the economy'. It's like a big oil tanker, it doens't just change course on a dime. But someone decided to put a great big iceberg right in its path, and I'm betting that will bring it to a stop *real fast*.

**Wildcards in the mix:**

* An upcoming bird flu epidemic which has already jumped to cattle and cats with high mortality rate; but measles might get there first
* The FBI and CIA are being actively purged, leaving the country open to [terrorist attacks](https://theonion.com/fbi-uncovers-al-qaeda-plot-to-just-sit-back-and-enjoy-c-1819576375/)
* Previously secure Federal IT has been breached creating breathtaking vulnerabilities in key system
* There is a cult of techno-feudalists who want the USA to collapse into Sovereign Crypto-bro Kingdoms, and both Musk and Thiel are part of it
* It is possible the regime is pushing for civil resistance to reach the level where they can declare martial law, which could lead to secession of Blue states and/or outright civil war

None of these are even neccesary for collapse, but they might speed up what I believe is already inevitable.


**So good news everyone: there will be no Trump 3rd term, and the US won't be joining a new axis of evil... it will barely survive the coming year. This will take the world economy with it. Brace yourselves**

**First, there's massive inflationary pressure right now:**

* Prices of imported goods have started to rise sharply because companies have to be prepared to weather tariff price spikes, if they actually happen or not
* International trade is no longer reliable, because the administration flip-flops on trade agreements daily, making goods less available
* Neighboring sources of vital construction materials are being antagonised while the country needs to rebuild after massive wildfires
* Agricultural output will be extremely unreliable due to... [*gestures broadly at everything*] but mostly deporting farm workers, bird flu and draining the california agricultural reservoirs

**Second, those same things can also trigger a recession and there's more:**

* The federal government is going to stop paying for things, basically at random. 20% of GDP is now unreliable.
* Crypto-bro tech-moguls are sniping at each other, presidents are hawking meme-coins, law enforcement is in the hands of partisan imbeciles and the SEC is about to be gutted. Fraud will run rampant. Noone knows if that will juice or tank the stock market, but it scares people
* Big Tech which contribues ~10% of US GDP directly has alligned itself with the government. Around the world but mostly in Europe boycots are forming. China releasing an AI competitor saw a 3% drop in the Nasdaq, with over half a trillion dollars wiped off of the valuation of one top stock. They are *fragile*, and particularly reliant on international suppliers like TSMC and ASML.
* It is entirely possible that the US will default on its debt, either by whim of its new rulers, or through gross incompetence of the hacker known as ~~4chan~~ BigBalls who has been put in charge of the treasury payment system. Something nearly impossible in normal circumstances could be ordered by the president, and be carried out before anyone realises what has happened. And then the dollar is over.

**Unemployment will be off the charts:**

* Tens of thousands of government workers are being (illegally) fired, and contractors dumped, aiming at up to a million unemployed - but that's just the start.
* Right now 30,000 are confirmed. But OPM has mandated firing 200,000 probationary employees hired just in the last year to be let go by september, and that's not even counting contractors. Federal agencies rely heavily on contract employees, so we can expect 2-3 contractors to lose their income per federal employee lost.
* That's the direct workers, but there's much more: when something like HUD is dismantled by cutting 84% of the ~8000 workers, that means it simply *cannot operate*. HUD administers programs like LIHTC and JPIP which support over 90.000 jobs annually, primarily small businesses.
* With USAID shut down by cutting 14.000 employees the spending *stops*; billions of dollars of that spending went to farms in the midwest that have lost their contracts, their livelyhoods. 80% of that 60 billion dollar USAID budget went to US firms - it was an indirect subsidy that secured hundreds of thousands of jobs.
* Then there's the hiring freezes all over - not just in the government but the affected programs like university-administered medical research.
* There's maybe two dozen people authorized to actually administer and pay out the 30 billion dollars per year that the IRA distributes, fire them and all that goes away. It's authorised, the money is there, it just doesn't get spent. That's a lot of jobs.
* This isn't even taking into account the people losing their jobs to the tariffs and further trade war insanity.

The ripple effects here are going to greatly disproportional to the first-order numbers.

Inflation is manageable. A recession is manageable. High unemployment is manageable. A failed harvest is manageable. A trade deal breaking up is manageable. A constitutional crisis is manageable. A supply chain disruption is manageable. A war is manageable. A reduction in government spending is manageable. A breakup of an alliance is manageable.

*But not all at once.*

If these trends all manage to hit, which they almost certainly will, we will be seeing a collapse of employment and industry combined with rising prices: classic 80's style stagflation. 

The inflation will be transitory - the prices will probably only go up initially as the tariffs are threatened, then imposed and trade starts to fail. After a short while of stockpiles depleting prices might go up a little more, but it would basically reach a new normal at a higher price point. Agriculture will recover, etc. Still, it's a good year or two of suck. In the mean time that inflation will paralyse the Fed: They'll want to lower rates to counter the recession, but bond markets would rebel because of the inflation. QE would be a possible response, but would also be seen as irresponsible with 'room to cut' being available and inflation already at a high point.

With the regime being too [redacted] to respond to the self-inflicted damage [things will turn nasty](https://youtu.be/68Dlb4B3m24?si=SFC7XrNTrhnuu84y&amp;t=138). With most adults in the room purged outright or sidelined, the recession will quickly transition to a [debt-deflation spiral](https://www.socialscience.international/hyman-minsky-financial-instability-hypothesis), and somewhere along the way the massive bubble in asset prices is going to pop and we'll see the 3rd [Minsky moment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minskymoment.asp) of the past century. That's when the **Greatest Depression** starts, folks.

Some believe that the regime's economic 'thinkers' (Bessent, Lutnick, Miran, Navarro) have explicitly planned to crush the economy as soon as possible so they can say it was ""biden’s economy"" that crashed; this would let them both profit off the collapse, and allow the president to swoop in and rescue the country. But be it malice or gross incompetence... such a rescue is not possible.

**Roadblocks to recovery:**

* The investments needed to re-shore and re-build the manufacturing capacity to compensate for supply that is being cut off internationally will not happen because expected returns are impossible to predict, and spending is already cratering
* Even if new factories are built - which would take years - to be profitable modern manufacturing is hyper-productive; it creates lots of product but almost no jobs. A few engineers and maintenance people can do the work of hundreds of manual labourers - there is no way to absorb the massive unemployment that's coming, and few able to afford the products.
* The last time the US was in stagflation was in the 1970s, it was ended with Volcker's Hammer - Paul Volcker, the head of the Fed, raised interest rates to 20%. This caused a severe recession which wrecked the economy and allowed a reset. The current leadership would not allow that. The president is pushing hard for interest rate cuts, and a head-on collision between the Federal Reserve and the office of the President will be intensely destructive to market confidence.
* Counteracting the collapsing stock market will require re-capitalisation by the Fed of various institutions that the regime *does not like*, and which its main economists would actively seek to prevent - by the time a 'healthy correction' had turned into a complete slaughter, the Fed will be powerless
* Recovery from any of these would be a difficult, long-term problem, maybe a decade or more. But the DOGE wrecking-ball is preventing anyone from even trying to recover or even maintain anything. They're gutting the federal government, firing everyone with the kind of institutional knowledge needed to staunch the bleeding or turn around a decline. At best there's going to be a survival situation, where they manage to salvage some of the nation's resources under their own control.

The modern world is filled with complexity that requires the admnistrative state, and despite claims to the contary it is not being made efficient... it is being systematically destroyed. 

The theory (such as it is) is that all government spending is inefficient, and 'crowds out' private enterprise. So if you get rid of the government, private enterprise will flourish. What actually happens is that aggregate demand plumets, and GDP gets wrecked. That's how when Greece cut 30% of government spening, it also lost 30% of its GDP. It hasn't recovered since 2010 and the US is now doing that to itself.

If I'm right, we'll see the first major shock come in on March 7th, when the febuary unemployment numbers come in. That won't be the worst of it, because there's a lot of inertia in 'the economy'. It's like a big oil tanker, it doens't just change course on a dime. But someone decided to put a great big iceberg right in its path, and I'm betting that will bring it to a stop *real fast*.

**Wildcards in the mix:**

* An upcoming bird flu epidemic which has already jumped to cattle and cats with high mortality rate; but measles might get there first
* The FBI and CIA are being actively purged, leaving the country open to [terrorist attacks](https://theonion.com/fbi-uncovers-al-qaeda-plot-to-just-sit-back-and-enjoy-c-1819576375/)
* Previously secure Federal IT has been breached creating breathtaking vulnerabilities in key system
* There is a cult of techno-feudalists who want the USA to collapse into Sovereign Crypto-bro Kingdoms, and both Musk and Thiel are part of it
* It is possible the regime is pushing for civil resistance to reach the level where they can declare martial law, which could lead to secession of Blue states and/or outright civil war

None of these are even neccesary for collapse, but they might speed up what I believe is already inevitable.


**So good news everyone: there will be no Trump 3rd term, and the US won't be joining a new axis of evil... it will barely survive the coming year. This will take the world economy with it. Brace yourselves**

2025-03-27,2025-03-27 06:06:12,Reddit,search_result,stocks,"Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs","Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.

Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one” for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.

Movements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla’s stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday’s selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.

The trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.

Following the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month “might not be indicative of true demand.”

New car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, “could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,” or a “new affordable model,” which they expect in the second half of the year.

Tesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.

Some prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk’s political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he’s leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.

William Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, “pushback from Musk’s foray into politics” has led to “brand damage and even vandalism,” for Tesla at a time when the company’s supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and “Chinese competition continues to heat up.”

Still, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla’s stock, pointing to growth in the company’s energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.

Alphabet’s Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.

In China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system “Intelligent Assisted Driving,” according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as “Full Self-driving Capability.” Tesla’s system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Decades of water mismanagement are leading to [a serious reckoning](https://globalvoices.org/2025/04/20/the-countdown-to-irans-day-zero-a-crisis-of-water-not-war/) in Iran, a “**day zero**” when Drought (already a strong factor in southern Iran) will have forced “climate refugees” towards the north, too crowded to sustain such numbers. A study was done in 2014 that forecasted Iran’s water to run out by 2029. More than two thirds of irrigation **water is lost** to leaks (compared to Iraq’s roughly 50%), and about 80% of water is used for farming. Dam-building and well-drilling has also been instrumentalized as a tool in Iran’s ethnic conflicts, with consequences for those who challenge this status quo. 

Criticism is [already emerging](https://peopledaily.digital/news/cop30-host-defended-against-climate-hypocrisy-accusation) over Brazil’s chairmanship of the November **COP30** conference in Belém (pop: 2.4M), Brazil.

Brazil’s oil exports [are projected to peak](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/economia/noticia/2025-01/driven-pre-salt-oil-becomes-brazils-top-export) in the 2030s. Furthermore, Brazil and other countries [are being criticized](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-countries-forests-mask-emission.html) for **overreporting the carbon sequestration** done by their forests to balance their carbon budgets. It was [reported last year](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-carbon-climate-change-deforestation-1bc52c85c90dd4c8b04de4c8cd77394e) that the Amazon rainforest itself was under threat of no longer being a carbon sink, and will become a source when deforestation reaches a certain point.

A [study](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/16/565/2025/) out of the European Geosciences Union claims that “the Amazon rainforest and permafrost, which are the two major tipping points within the Earth's carbon cycle” threaten a **high probability of runaway climate tipping points** under [SSP2-4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways), the intermediate climate pathway which expects **2 °C warming by about 2050**, and approximately 3 °C by 2100. “Our most conservative estimate of triggering probabilities averaged over all tipping points is 62 % under SSP2-4.5, and nine tipping points have a more than 50 % probability of getting triggered.” Some of the tipping points include: boreal permafrost collapse, AMOC collapse, Amazon rainforest dieback, Labrador-Irminger seas [convection collapse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01296-9), and loss of mountain glaciers.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02132-4) found that coastal blue carbon ecosystems—like the Baltic Sea floor studied here—are at risk of becoming a source of CO2. The Baltic Sea already is, because of a combination of dredging, bottom trawling (which disturbs sediment on the seafloor) and storms (which also disturb seafloor sediment).

How can we quantify the damage done to our environment? A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08751-3) from last week tries to answer this, and determined that Chevron “caused between US $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over the period 1991–2020.” A [summary](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-world-biggest-companies-trillion-climate.html) of the study pinned down the damage from the world’s largest corporations at approximately **$28T USD**, presumably over the same period of time. Earth Day passed without much notice; scientists say [we have transgressed](https://archive.ph/FF0HF) six of the [**nine planetary boundaries**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries): “climate change, ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, biogeochemical flows in the nitrogen cycle, excess global freshwater use, land system change, the erosion of biosphere integrity, chemical pollution, and atmospheric aerosol loading.”

The British government [has approved](https://archive.ph/pACC1) a solar reflection **geoengineering project** in which they will **spray aerosols** into the atmosphere within weeks.

Experts believe that the virus is likely to evolve further [through transmissions among mammals](https://archive.ph/eAdW1)—where it then may one day make the jump to become human-human transmissible. The good news? Scientists [made a vaccine](https://www.futurity.org/experimental-bird-flu-vaccine-3278062/) that shows great promise for mice.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92403-z) in *Nature Scientific Reports* examined **mortality rates from COVID** in the year 2020, and attempted to find which factors were most effective in mitigating deaths. Countries with stronger “rule of law,” rainfall, and sea borders tended to have better survival rates from COVID. Interestingly, they found “**no evidence that the number of physicians per 1,000 people is a good predictor of excess mortality**. Nor do we find evidence for a (partial) correlation with the number of hospital beds per capita, government spending on healthcare, or overall spending on healthcare.” The study also found that “an additional $10,000 {per capita income} per year is associated with 0.03 fewer deaths. However, the results suggest no impact of our other measures of macroeconomic performance — unemployment, inflation and public debt.” Countries with school closures had higher death rates, but the authors believe it was “because countries struggling most to manage the pandemic were more likely to have to close schools, rather than school closures somehow driving excess mortality.”

The U.S. Dollar [dropped](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/21/investing/us-stock-market/index.html) to its lowest (measured against 6 other currencies) in 3 years, following tumult in the U.S. stock market. The U.S. FDA is [**pausing its milk safety testing**](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/fda-milk-quality-testing-program-182659482.html) after a government layoff fired about 2,000 FDA workers. American tariffs [are prompting more government borrowing](https://archive.ph/tEVe5) across the world, pushing states closer to a financial disaster. **Shadow banks** meanwhile [reportedly](https://archive.ph/tSh2E) manage “49% of the world’s financial assets”......that’s 15x of what they controlled in 2008.

About [650,000 starving people in Ethiopia are losing their food aid](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/un-food-agency-cites-funding-gap-as-it-halts-aid-to-650000-in-ethiopia) as a result of UN budgetary issues. Another 3M are expected to see much of their aid from the World Food Programme be cut in the coming weeks, based on current financial pressures. “**Conflict, instability and drought**” are the key factors behind this famine. Meanwhile [a paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01133-y) in *Nature Food* claims that “diets that limit meat consumption to 255g per week” (chicken &amp; pork only; beef is a no-go) are sustainable in line with the Paris goal of 1.5 °C (lol).

The American Lung Association released its 155-page “[**State of the Air**](https://www.lung.org/getmedia/5d8035e5-4e86-4205-b408-865550860783/State-of-the-Air-2025.pdf)” report—in which they claim Los Angeles is the nation’s city with the worst ozone pollution (a record L.A. has kept for 25 of the last 26 years). 2024 was also the 7th year on record of overall worsening small particle pollution, largely from wildfires. The report is mostly composed of data tables. Meanwhile, [a short Reuters article](https://archive.ph/N3EYZ) casts some light on the **most air-polluted metro area in the world in India**: “Everything is covered with dust or soot.”

&gt;“85 million people living in 115 counties across 31 states have been exposed to year-round levels of particle pollution that do not meet the annual air quality standard...given the transport of wildfire smoke across the country, the states with the worst changes from last year’s report are mainly in the north central and eastern parts of the U.S….Most premature deaths are from respiratory and cardiovascular causes….Annual particle pollution levels are most often highest in places that are subject to multiple sources of emissions all year long, such as from highways, oil and gas extraction, power generation and industry…” -excerpts from the report

Meanwhile, [research](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425310122) published in *PNAS* claims that half of U.S. counties—containing some 50M Americans—lack air quality monitoring stations. These so-called “**monitoring deserts**” are mostly in the Midwest &amp; U.S. South. Meanwhile, [FEMA is cutting 20% of its staff](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/23/politics/fema-staff-cuts-hurricane-season/index.html) just before hurricane season takes off.

A [study](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/4/pgaf096/8113371?login=true) on antibiotics in surface freshwater estimates “that 10% of antibiotics consumed by humans arrive at surface waters,” This is concerning because human use of antibiotics rose 65% between 2000-2015, and has risen since then. Some diseases, like a strain of typhoid fever, [are developing **resistance**](https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-study-warns) **to antibiotics**. At least a moment of good news: scientists [developed a treatment](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/14/new-gonorrhoea-treatment-gepotidacin-hailed-breakthrough-drug-resistance) for antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. 

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972500453X?via%3Dihub) examined how microplastics of different shapes &amp; sizes can slip through wastewater treatment plants. Microplastics’ shapes are grouped into 6 categories: “fragments (broken-off parts), beads (spherical-shaped), foams (sponge-like mass), fibers (string-shaped), films (thin sheets), and granules (irregular pieces).” Various methods to remove microplastics achieve success rates of over 90%, but few methods reliably remove more than 99% of microplastics. “Once MPs enter the body, they act as **toxic carriers** for organic pollutants and pathogens that can later leach out, intensifying their toxicity.” 

**More, more, always more**. Japan is [bring urged](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/04/21/nvidia-ceo-japan-power-ai/) to generate more electricity to power its AI needs, now and in the future. A number of Asian countries in particular are [planning on boosting LNG imports](https://archive.ph/zGi83) from the U.S. At an energy summit in London last week, [the EU and UK reaffirmed](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/24/eu-and-uk-underline-commitment-to-energy-transition-at-london-summit) their commitment to renewable energy—will they deliver on their promises? Russia meanwhile [reaffirmed its plan](https://archive.ph/wPWYo) to construct a small **nuclear power plant in Myanmar**, despite their recent earthquake.

On Tuesday, [militants in Pakistan **massacred 26 Indian tourists**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/tourists-killed-by-suspected-militants-in-kashmir-attack), and injured others. India in response [closed part of its land border and **suspended a key water treaty**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/indian-security-forces-hunt-militants-after-tourists-killed-in-kashmir-attack) with Pakistan—for [the first time](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vjyezypqo) ever. In response, Pakistan [shut off its airspace](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/india-pakistan-summons-kashmir-attack) to Indian aircraft, and announced that “Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus waters treaty…will be considered as an act of war and responded {to} with full force across the complete spectrum of national power.” [Allegations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/25/kashmir-attack-pahalgam-india-pakistan-army-chief-visit-srinagar) of isolated exchanges of fire have been reported, and security opreations ongoing within each nation’s borders. It has become a [contest of honor](https://archive.ph/iqhyT) in which neither side wants to lose face. How farcical would it be if humanity was shamed into starting **WWIII**?

The M23 rebels in the eastern DRC [have made a **surprise ceasefire**](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20250424-dr-congo-and-m23-announce-joint-pledge-to-reach-ceasefire) with government forces, while discussions continue in Qatar. This is the 7th ceasefire/truce to be made over the last 4 years; all six previous ones collapsed into violence. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso’s ruling junta [claims to have foiled an attempted coup](https://www.dw.com/en/burkina-faso-junta-says-it-foiled-coup-attempt/a-72305538). 

President Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act last week, [as many predicted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/17/could-trump-invoke-insurrection-act-and-what-powers-would-that-give-him). On the 100th day of Trump’s presidency, Human Rights Watch [published an article](https://www.hrw.org/feature/2025/04/24/100-human-rights-harms-100-days/trump-administrations-assault-rights-united) on **100 different alleged violations** against human rights. Many of them extend beyond the U.S. borders. 

&gt;“Millions of people in the US may experience new impediments to receiving Medicaid
benefits, food assistance, childcare, and other services….the Department of Homeland Security rescinded a previous policy barring immigration agents from raiding churches, mosques, schools, and hospitals….Millions of people around the world will find it more challenging to access contraception….announced **65 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency** (EPA) budget….more than 400 staff were dismissed from the Department of Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service, including from its Office of Law Enforcement….People mistreated by police officers have even fewer places to turn to report misconduct….International students and scholars have been arbitrarily arrested and ordered **deported in retaliation for their political viewpoints and activism**….commercial AI systems could be trained on sensitive government data….Millions of people who live with HIV and AIDS have had their access to treatments undermined or eliminated….US foreign aid cuts that ended or disrupted mine clearance operations….” -excerpts from the 16-page report

**Pope Francis** [**died**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/25/pope-francis-funeral-preparations-vatican) last week, although this is hardly a Collapse-related story; his successor will be elected next month. The U.S. [positioned anti-ship missiles](https://archive.ph/kVL6P) in some Philippines islands (facing the Taiwan strait) for the first time, ostensibly to deter Chinese aggression. Germany’s right-wing [AfD party polled the highest](https://uatv.ua/en/german-far-right-solidifies-position-as-most-popular-party-poll/) among all German parties for the first time ever last week. Eritrea’s [**authoritarian state** expands](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/4/22/away-from-the-global-spotlight-eritreans-are-trapped-in-a-garrison-state) its tentacles—and tightens its grip on society. Japan [unveiled a new **electromagnetic railgun**](https://archive.ph/C7FPF), to be mounted on their sea vessels, which can allegedly intercept hypersonic missiles. 

Israel has quietly [renamed “humanitarian zones” in Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/israel-ends-mention-of-humanitarian-zones-as-gaza-war-grinds-on) as “**security buffer zones**,” and 70% of the isolated territory is now under evacuation orders or **occupation**. Meanwhile [Israeli airstrikes continue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/eleven-killed-in-gaza-school-shelter-as-israel-continues-bombing-campaign), including one which slew 11 at a shelter on Wednesday. On Thursday, [IDF airstrikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g28g02ng2o) killed 50 across Gaza. In the ruins of Gaza, a [new threat is emerging](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y4j91l83o): **asbestos**, widely used across a number of old buildings and refugee camps—now released into the air through the dust of rubble and smoke. As [one Israeli Lieutenant General said](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250424-gaza-rescuers-say-israeli-strikes-kill-53), “If we do not see progress in the return of the hostages in the near future, we will expand our activities to a larger and more significant operation.” 

An [**explosion at Iran’s largest port**](https://archive.ph/vWyQd) killed 4+ and injured 500+ others. More [opposition figures were arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/tanzania-tundu-lissu-court-treason-opposition-detained) in Tanzania last week, following charges of treason against the President’s top political opponent. **Al-Shabaab terrorists** [claim to have seized](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/24/al-shabab-battles-somalias-army-for-strategic-military-base) a base in Somalia after a battle that killed 30+, though Somalia’s government contests this. Meanwhile, in Haiti, [**gangster-soldiers** killed 4 soldiers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/portauprince-haiti-gangs-carrefour-kenyan-b2738785.html) and 4 civilians last week...and some people [say](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/21/haiti-is-nearing-point-of-no-return-as-gang-violence-surges-un-official) that Haiti still hasn’t reached “the point of no return”—but might soon… 

A **Russian airstrike**—allegedly using a North Korean missile—[killed 12 in Kyiv](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/kyiv-ukraine-killed-dozens-injured-massive-russian-missile-attack) on Tuesday. [Drone attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/26/i-havent-slept-for-two-days-kharkiv-residents-reel-from-russian-attacks) in Kharkiv injured several. 100,000+ tons of War materiél [exploded in Russia](https://archive.ph/KVlaL) after a Ukrainian airstrike reportedly [blasted](https://old.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1k5fqh3/100000_tons_of_ammunition_went_up_it_was_one_of/) one of Russia’s largest ammunition depots. Russia [claims](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx26166ngpdo) to have now retaken all of Ukrainian-occupied Kursk.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ [**Canada votes**](https://globalnews.ca/news/11141672/canada-election-ipsos-poll-final-week/) for its Parliament on Monday. Trump’s accession to the presidency completely upended the political situation in Canada, and now it appears like a narrow plurality of voters prefer the Liberals over the Conservatives. No other party [is currently polling](https://archive.ph/U6uO9) above 9%. **Canada will not be saved** by any result.

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-**Arctic sea ice is at an all-time low**, when measuring the volume, anyway. [This weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k49tuz/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mogiisw/) cites the progressively large temperature anomalies in the Arctic circle, and its children comments link more resources on understanding Arctic Amplification. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/22/canada-borders-tensions-warming-arctic-ice-military-defence-climate-change) on Canada’s warming north explains vulnerabilities and security challenges caused by the rapidly warming region.

-**Poverty, biodiversity dieoff, and desertification** are coming—along with a lot more, based on [this set of predictions](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k6kmtj/unless_there_will_be_a_dramatic_shift_to_the_left/) cross-posted to the subreddit last week. Some commenters think **it’s going to be a lot worse**.

-It can be goddamn difficult for many people to be open &amp; honest, says [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k71alj/being_collapseaware_is_about_having_the_courage/) on **priorities**, integrity, and our attitudes towards discomfort… What would happen if we all started being 100% truthful towards each other?

The world’s oceans and coral reefs are [undergoing their worst bleaching event](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/23/coral-reef-bleaching-worst-global-event-on-record) on record. Scientists say this event has lasted about 48 months (and counting), and has affected more than 80% of earth’s coral reefs.

Peat bogs are [burning at a Polish nature reserve](https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2025-04-22/pozar-biebrzanskiego-parku-narodowego-minister-przekazala-dobre-informacje/), but authorities say the wildfire is under control. The U.S EPA has [**taken offline** a map](https://archive.ph/jmQ5p) of dangerous chemical facility locations; now find such sites in your area, you must now [submit a FOIA request](https://www.epa.gov/rmp/how-access-risk-management-plan-information). Meanwhile, a 6.3 [**earthquake** in Ecuador](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjnwzdmdywo) killed at least 20 and damaged infrastructure. The UK’s first few months of 2025 have been [their **driest in 40+ years**](https://archive.ph/bxwgo); Türkiye’s start to the year [was their driest](https://www.turkishminute.com/2025/04/21/turkey-sees-driest-march-in-35-years-meteorological-data-show/) in 35+ years... [Flash flooding in Nairobi](https://x.com/WeatherMonitors/status/1915488624579137650) killed 7.

Decades of water mismanagement are leading to [a serious reckoning](https://globalvoices.org/2025/04/20/the-countdown-to-irans-day-zero-a-crisis-of-water-not-war/) in Iran, a “**day zero**” when Drought (already a strong factor in southern Iran) will have forced “climate refugees” towards the north, too crowded to sustain such numbers. A study was done in 2014 that forecasted Iran’s water to run out by 2029. More than two thirds of irrigation **water is lost** to leaks (compared to Iraq’s roughly 50%), and about 80% of water is used for farming. Dam-building and well-drilling has also been instrumentalized as a tool in Iran’s ethnic conflicts, with consequences for those who challenge this status quo. 

Criticism is [already emerging](https://peopledaily.digital/news/cop30-host-defended-against-climate-hypocrisy-accusation) over Brazil’s chairmanship of the November **COP30** conference in Belém (pop: 2.4M), Brazil. Some take issue with a new highway being built through part of the city’s jungle, and Brazil’s **expanding oil extraction** (at [over 4M barrels per day](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-top-oil-producing-countries-updated-2024), it is the world’s 7th largest oil “producer”). Brazil’s oil exports [are projected to peak](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/economia/noticia/2025-01/driven-pre-salt-oil-becomes-brazils-top-export) in the 2030s. Furthermore, Brazil and other countries [are being criticized](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-countries-forests-mask-emission.html) for **overreporting the carbon sequestration** done by their forests to balance their carbon budgets. It was [reported last year](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-carbon-climate-change-deforestation-1bc52c85c90dd4c8b04de4c8cd77394e) that the Amazon rainforest itself was under threat of no longer being a carbon sink, and will become a source when deforestation reaches a certain point.

A [study](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/16/565/2025/) out of the European Geosciences Union claims that “the Amazon rainforest and permafrost, which are the two major tipping points within the Earth's carbon cycle” threaten a **high probability of runaway climate tipping points** under [SSP2-4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways), the intermediate climate pathway which expects **2 °C warming by about 2050**, and approximately 3 °C by 2100. “Our most conservative estimate of triggering probabilities averaged over all tipping points is 62 % under SSP2-4.5, and nine tipping points have a more than 50 % probability of getting triggered.” Some of the tipping points include: boreal permafrost collapse, AMOC collapse, Amazon rainforest dieback, Labrador-Irminger seas [convection collapse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01296-9), and loss of mountain glaciers.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02132-4) found that coastal blue carbon ecosystems—like the Baltic Sea floor studied here—are at risk of becoming a source of CO2. The Baltic Sea already is, because of a combination of dredging, bottom trawling (which disturbs sediment on the seafloor) and storms (which also disturb seafloor sediment). [**Brutally hot nights** in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1915351322150215960) (over 31 °C / 88 °F in some places) set records, while [chronic water shortages](https://shafaq.com/en/Iraq/Point-of-no-return-Iraq-s-fight-to-save-its-environment) worsen across the region.

**Drought** in southern &amp; northern Africa [is expected to worsen](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-severe-drought-africa-persists-worsen.html) in the coming months. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02214-3) suggests that Canada’s 2023 wildfires caused so much air pollution that temperatures in and around New Jersey dropped 3 °C. In the present day, a [heat wave](https://www.chinimandi.com/prolonged-heatwave-to-grip-pakistan-starting-today/) rolled through Pakistan, Utah’s governor [declared a **state of emergency**](https://www.kpcw.org/state-regional/2025-04-25/utah-gov-declares-state-of-emergency-as-drought-conditions-continue) over worsening Drought, and [heat records were broken](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/thailand-records-scorching-temperatures-amid-climate-concerns-335920) in Thailand.

How can we quantify the damage done to our environment? A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08751-3) from last week tries to answer this, and determined that Chevron “caused between US $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over the period 1991–2020.” A [summary](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-world-biggest-companies-trillion-climate.html) of the study pinned down the damage from the world’s largest corporations at approximately **$28T USD**, presumably over the same period of time. Earth Day passed without much notice; scientists say [we have transgressed](https://archive.ph/FF0HF) six of the [**nine planetary boundaries**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries): “climate change, ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, biogeochemical flows in the nitrogen cycle, excess global freshwater use, land system change, the erosion of biosphere integrity, chemical pollution, and atmospheric aerosol loading.”

The British government [has approved](https://archive.ph/pACC1) a solar reflection **geoengineering project** in which they will **spray aerosols** into the atmosphere within weeks. They hope to therefore brighten clouds, which will reflect solar radiation (sunlight) back into space. Meanwhile, a [pre-publication study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6005409/v1) into China’s reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution found that the measure was good for lung health, but **accelerated global warming**. 

**Sea surface temperature anomalies** [continue](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lni42nys622w) at almost-record highs. Water reserves in Athens [are lowering](https://greekreporter.com/2025/04/22/greece-tackle-water-shortage-attica-tanker-ship-emergency-plan/). Eastern Europe [felt a **heat wave**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1914747973063598243) earlier this week. Parts of Japan [felt new April heat records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1914264461977833857); as did [Vanuatu](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1914148319309295883). The observatory at Mauna Loa [recorded **430 ppm** of CO2](https://x.com/LeonSimons8/status/1914422933864202265). A [hailstorm](https://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/hailstorm-in-lleida-area-damages-up-to-50000-hectares-of-crops) in Catalonia damaged 50,000 hectares of crops (equivalent to a bit less than Guam or Ibiza).

Bird flu contact tracers believe that [bird flu was transmitted to U.S. dairy cows](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-found-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-heres-why-thats-terrifying/) beginning from a **single transmission event in 2023**. This H5N1 was then exchanged among cows (and other animals) and then back to birds, where it then spread more widely. Experts believe that the virus is likely to evolve further [through transmissions among mammals](https://archive.ph/eAdW1)—where it then may one day make the jump to become human-human transmissible. The good news? Scientists [made a vaccine](https://www.futurity.org/experimental-bird-flu-vaccine-3278062/) that shows great promise for mice. Vietnam meanwhile [recorded its first 2025 bird flu case](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-h5n1-avian-flu-case-encephalitis) in a human. 

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92403-z) in *Nature Scientific Reports* examined **mortality rates from COVID** in the year 2020, and attempted to find which factors were most effective in mitigating deaths. Countries with stronger “rule of law,” rainfall, and sea borders tended to have better survival rates from COVID. Interestingly, they found “**no evidence that the number of physicians per 1,000 people is a good predictor of excess mortality**. Nor do we find evidence for a (partial) correlation with the number of hospital beds per capita, government spending on healthcare, or overall spending on healthcare.” The study also found that “an additional $10,000 {per capita income} per year is associated with 0.03 fewer deaths. However, the results suggest no impact of our other measures of macroeconomic performance — unemployment, inflation and public debt.” Countries with school closures had higher death rates, but the authors believe it was “because countries struggling most to manage the pandemic were more likely to have to close schools, rather than school closures somehow driving excess mortality.”

The U.S. Dollar [dropped](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/21/investing/us-stock-market/index.html) to its lowest (measured against 6 other currencies) in 3 years, following tumult in the U.S. stock market.

About [650,000 starving people in Ethiopia are losing their food aid](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/un-food-agency-cites-funding-gap-as-it-halts-aid-to-650000-in-ethiopia) as a result of UN budgetary issues. Another 3M are expected to see much of their aid from the World Food Programme be cut in the coming weeks, based on current financial pressures. “**Conflict, instability and drought**” are the key factors behind this famine. Meanwhile [a paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01133-y) in *Nature Food* claims that “diets that limit meat consumption to 255g per week” (chicken &amp; pork only; beef is a no-go) are sustainable in line with the Paris goal of 1.5 °C (lol).

The report is mostly composed of data tables. Meanwhile, [a short Reuters article](https://archive.ph/N3EYZ) casts some light on the **most air-polluted metro area in the world in India**: “Everything is covered with dust or soot.”

&gt;“85 million people living in 115 counties across 31 states have been exposed to year-round levels of particle pollution that do not meet the annual air quality standard...given the transport of wildfire smoke across the country, the states with the worst changes from last year’s report are mainly in the north central and eastern parts of the U.S….Most premature deaths are from respiratory and cardiovascular causes….Annual particle pollution levels are most often highest in places that are subject to multiple sources of emissions all year long, such as from highways, oil and gas extraction, power generation and industry…” -excerpts from the report

Meanwhile, [research](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425310122) published in *PNAS* claims that half of U.S. counties—containing some 50M Americans—lack air quality monitoring stations.

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972500453X?via%3Dihub) examined how microplastics of different shapes &amp; sizes can slip through wastewater treatment plants. Microplastics’ shapes are grouped into 6 categories: “fragments (broken-off parts), beads (spherical-shaped), foams (sponge-like mass), fibers (string-shaped), films (thin sheets), and granules (irregular pieces).” Various methods to remove microplastics achieve success rates of over 90%, but few methods reliably remove more than 99% of microplastics. “Once MPs enter the body, they act as **toxic carriers** for organic pollutants and pathogens that can later leach out, intensifying their toxicity.”

&gt;So if water gets too expensive, you won’t buy it?
&gt;&gt;I generally don't buy imported water. Should we really be wasting water to ship drinking water around the world? Fuck it. I say 1.000% tariff on all drinking water imports. If you wanna drink Fiji or Evian or Topo Chico or Liquid Death, you should pay for it. But you know what else tariffs do? They bring manufacturing into the country. My wife is Brazilian. I'm Brazil, tariffs are so high, brands like Heineken and Stella are domestic brands. They're manufactured in Brazil so there's no tariff or shipping costs added. It's a good thing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And how do they bring manufacturing back? Come on, I'm sure we've got the answer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should really watch three real news. What do you know about trump's trip to the Arabian peninsula? Did anything good happen?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you answer a question?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My punt is you're unaware that manufacturing is coming back. If you kept informed you'd know that.  Here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/15/us-will-build-massive-ai-data-center-in-abu-dhabi-see-the-list-of-deals-trump-announced-in-the-middle-east/

&gt;You just missed the point, he’s saying that the American people are paying for the tariffs, even if it’s going straight to the government it’s not coming out of nowhere, it’s still the American people having to pay for it, it’s like paying extra taxes that you won’t be getting back at the start of the next tax season.
&gt;&gt;So. Going into this, China was taxing us 8% and we were taxing them 3%. It looks like, going forward, China's tax will be 10% on our experts and we are trading China 10% also. But for now, it's 30% until they stop sending illegal fentanyl to our streets.
&gt;&gt;&gt;""Until they stop sending fentanyl to our streets."" Wow, the naivety of that statement is almost endearing. Almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welp. That's the deal. Nothing happens in China, not in the scale of the fentanyl epidemic, without the knowledge abs approval of the CCP. They're waging chemical warfare.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep. I also heard Santa Claus and Colonel Sanders are going to team up and deliver aaaaalll the illegal immigrants back to their homes. Bet you can’t wait for Christmas, can ya buster?

[and why are those prices higher?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy0lw3/)
&gt;The latest inflation numbers has inflation at 2.4% so, even with tariffs, prices are rising show than in the part 4 years. Inflation is lower than wage growth. Take an economics class.
&gt;&gt;I did, 1989 professor isplahani, university of La Verne.  who did you learn economics from?  a teletubby?  ""inflation is lower than wage growth"" wow.... you're almost there! you almost figured out why inflation isn't the sole excuse why prices are high.  but until you show me your bonofides and economic training, I'm placing you into the dunning-kreuger pile.
&gt;&gt;&gt;So if you've taken economicsthen you understand everything I'm telling you and there's no need for this conversation. We're not even disagreeing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;except you've clearly NOT taken any economics and probably failed basic literacy tests several times, because I'm disagreeing with you and so does reality.  go back to trumplestan where you'll be cheered like a hero for making a lib cry or whatever participation trophy MAGAts give each other

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok? That doesn’t mean that the full stock is back to where it was. In fact, you can literally make money off of stocks crashing. It’s called shorting. So again tell me how the amount of money one person made matters at all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wdym is back to where it was, what's a full stock lmao, stop acting like you remotely know anything about it. Everyone knows what shorting is, I didn't short. The fact that I'm up 50% after an investment pre covid means that the market isn't just fine, it's doing better, try and explain how without shorting I was able to get that return and I'll tell you you won't be able to do it without stroking my ego

Life is good here! Eggs 🥚 and gas ⛽️ are now affordable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy3pfv/)
&gt;Gas is up to $3.20 here
&gt;&gt;I guess it depends on location. Gas prices on the gulf coast are lower. My medicine still cost the same at the pharmacy yesterday though. 🧐
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it $1.98 on the coast?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still haven’t seen it that low 😂, but saying it’s cheaper is true. The lowest gas price I have seen on the coast since he has been in office was $2.12. The gas station owners may have purchased it for $1.98 but they were not selling it for that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cool, just so we’re clear that he is lying.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the $1.98 post, Yes. In the post above, No. Has there been a president that hasn’t lied or stretched the truth 🤥?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks for confirming

[Gas is up $0.10 since he took office? Oil is down $10 or 14%. The math ain’t math in](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy7qf4/)
&gt;Here, It was $4.12 a gallon last year. I can go get gas for $2.45 since a gallon right now. I’m not making that up. I guess it depends on where you are located.
&gt;&gt;Good for you I’m taking national averages. You can thank Joe Biden for that! And I’m not trying to be dick. Actually go look at gas price charts. I’m sure your reduction in price almost completely happened before trump took office.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Well the national average price of a dozen eggs dropped over a dollar in the last month. I can buy them for 3 dollars a dozen less than a mile away. The national average was $6.23 now it’s closer to $5.12.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;January 2025: The national average price for a dozen large eggs reached $4.95, surpassing the previous record set in January 2023.  February 2025: The average price jumped to $5.90, a 19.2% increase from January.  March 2025: Prices continued to climb, reaching a record high of $6.23.  April 2025: Prices decreased to $5.12, a 17.8% decrease from March.  According to Google, it’s still higher than before Trump took office by $0.17. $6.23 is the highest in national history. I am not sure how you see these numbers as swaying positive for the current administration.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CNN (Not Fox News).](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/business/egg-prices-trump-inflation). True! In January, when Trump took over. Egg prices were high AF.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And he made them significantly higher, and they are still higher across the nation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, you mean facts that are backed up? With zero facts you have sited and it is just based upon a belief. That is very religion/cult.  I have a bridge I'll sell you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You plan on siting that bridge?  We all know your lies are rooted solely in hate in bigotry. No one is cutting off anything from children. You weirdos just vomit that propaganda to soothe the fact that you are nothing but weird bigots.

 Anyone know the effects?  It did not work and the United States sank deeper into the Depression.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Truth! In fact many economists are saying it was tariffs that caused the Great Depression in the first place, they say if nothing else they impacted it.

[Dip shit republicans will believe any lie that he tells them. They can't afford groceries, but they'll scream it's so much better now that they can't feed their kids. Lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxuakg/)
&gt;Are you good? We can feed our kids and buy groceries 🤣 why aren’t y’all talking about them egg prices anymore? Gas is 2.48 by my house it wasn’t under 4 nearly all of bidens term. Delusional left back at it again because Reddit told them so.
&gt;&gt;They're just butthurt that we were right, and we're winning. Can't help but laugh at the weakest, stupidest people having a circle jerk about how dumb everyone else is, though. Never gets old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;What exactly are you ""winning""? And what have you been right about?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;America is winning, Trump was right, and it's pretty great. Stop listening to a bunch of uneducated morons on reddit and touch grass. You might get to enjoy it too.

[Higher prices mean reduced demand, you economic genus!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxz0tf/)
&gt;So if water gets too expensive, you won’t buy it?
&gt;&gt;I generally don't buy imported water. Should we really be wasting water to ship drinking water around the world? Fuck it. I say 1.000% tariff on all drinking water imports. If you wanna drink Fiji or Evian or Topo Chico or Liquid Death, you should pay for it. But you know what else tariffs do? They bring manufacturing into the country. My wife is Brazilian. I'm Brazil, tariffs are so high, brands like Heineken and Stella are domestic brands. They're manufactured in Brazil so there's no tariff or shipping costs added. It's a good thing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And how do they bring manufacturing back? Come on, I'm sure we've got the answer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should really watch three real news. What do you know about trump's trip to the Arabian peninsula? Did anything good happen?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you answer a question?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My punt is you're unaware that manufacturing is coming back. If you kept informed you'd know that.  Here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/15/us-will-build-massive-ai-data-center-in-abu-dhabi-see-the-list-of-deals-trump-announced-in-the-middle-east/

[It does go straight to the government. The second it's declared as it comes through customs. How do you think it works, genius?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxup3z/)
&gt;You just missed the point, he’s saying that the American people are paying for the tariffs, even if it’s going straight to the government it’s not coming out of nowhere, it’s still the American people having to pay for it, it’s like paying extra taxes that you won’t be getting back at the start of the next tax season.
&gt;&gt;So. Going into this, China was taxing us 8% and we were taxing them 3%. It looks like, going forward, China's tax will be 10% on our experts and we are trading China 10% also. But for now, it's 30% until they stop sending illegal fentanyl to our streets.
&gt;&gt;&gt;""Until they stop sending fentanyl to our streets."" Wow, the naivety of that statement is almost endearing. Almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welp. That's the deal. Nothing happens in China, not in the scale of the fentanyl epidemic, without the knowledge abs approval of the CCP. They're waging chemical warfare.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep. I also heard Santa Claus and Colonel Sanders are going to team up and deliver aaaaalll the illegal immigrants back to their homes. Bet you can’t wait for Christmas, can ya buster?

[and why are those prices higher?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy0lw3/)
&gt;The latest inflation numbers has inflation at 2.4% so, even with tariffs, prices are rising show than in the part 4 years. Inflation is lower than wage growth. Take an economics class.
&gt;&gt;I did, 1989 professor isplahani, university of La Verne.  who did you learn economics from?  a teletubby?  ""inflation is lower than wage growth"" wow.... you're almost there! you almost figured out why inflation isn't the sole excuse why prices are high.  but until you show me your bonofides and economic training, I'm placing you into the dunning-kreuger pile.
&gt;&gt;&gt;So if you've taken economicsthen you understand everything I'm telling you and there's no need for this conversation. We're not even disagreeing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;except you've clearly NOT taken any economics and probably failed basic literacy tests several times, because I'm disagreeing with you and so does reality.  go back to trumplestan where you'll be cheered like a hero for making a lib cry or whatever participation trophy MAGAts give each other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have two business degrees.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and no education. degrees from trump University and the school of hard knocks don't count.

[stocks are up, you guys were lying about that too, every 2% of stocks dropping from tariffs liberals were like ""stocks crashing!!! :@@@"" fucking hysterics the lot of you](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxvh9z/)
&gt;Here we have a prime example of the aforementioned ""dip shit republicans""
&gt;&gt;Guy probably walks into a casino with $100, walks out with $20, and thinks he won twenty bucks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I put 6000 dollars in stocks for a large part tesla, I doubled that investment just now 12000 in my bank account, dumbass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok? That doesn’t mean that the full stock is back to where it was. In fact, you can literally make money off of stocks crashing. It’s called shorting. So again tell me how the amount of money one person made matters at all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wdym is back to where it was, what's a full stock lmao, stop acting like you remotely know anything about it. Everyone knows what shorting is, I didn't short. The fact that I'm up 50% after an investment pre covid means that the market isn't just fine, it's doing better, try and explain how without shorting I was able to get that return and I'll tell you you won't be able to do it without stroking my ego

Life is good here! Eggs 🥚 and gas ⛽️ are now affordable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy3pfv/)
&gt;Gas is up to $3.20 here
&gt;&gt;I guess it depends on location. Gas prices on the gulf coast are lower. My medicine still cost the same at the pharmacy yesterday though. 🧐
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it $1.98 on the coast?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still haven’t seen it that low 😂, but saying it’s cheaper is true. The lowest gas price I have seen on the coast since he has been in office was $2.12. The gas station owners may have purchased it for $1.98 but they were not selling it for that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cool, just so we’re clear that he is lying.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the $1.98 post, Yes. In the post above, No. Has there been a president that hasn’t lied or stretched the truth 🤥?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks for confirming

[Gas is up $0.10 since he took office? Oil is down $10 or 14%. The math ain’t math in](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy7qf4/)
&gt;Here, It was $4.12 a gallon last year. I can go get gas for $2.45 since a gallon right now. I’m not making that up. I guess it depends on where you are located.
&gt;&gt;Good for you I’m taking national averages. You can thank Joe Biden for that! And I’m not trying to be dick. Actually go look at gas price charts. I’m sure your reduction in price almost completely happened before trump took office.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Well the national average price of a dozen eggs dropped over a dollar in the last month. I can buy them for 3 dollars a dozen less than a mile away. The national average was $6.23 now it’s closer to $5.12.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;January 2025: The national average price for a dozen large eggs reached $4.95, surpassing the previous record set in January 2023.  February 2025: The average price jumped to $5.90, a 19.2% increase from January.  March 2025: Prices continued to climb, reaching a record high of $6.23.  April 2025: Prices decreased to $5.12, a 17.8% decrease from March.  According to Google, it’s still higher than before Trump took office by $0.17. $6.23 is the highest in national history. I am not sure how you see these numbers as swaying positive for the current administration.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CNN (Not Fox News).](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/business/egg-prices-trump-inflation). True! In January, when Trump took over. Egg prices were high AF.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And he made them significantly higher, and they are still higher across the nation.

[I am glad he is making the US his first priority. Better in every way first time POTUS has made America better in the last 4years](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msy2utx/)

&gt;&gt;This coming from a person who wants to cut the genitals off of children.  Yep, I'm in a ""cult"", weirdo.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The fact that you think that specifically tells us you are in a weird culture. Calm down with the TDS. It's a really bad look.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, you mean facts that are backed up? With zero facts you have sited and it is just based upon a belief. That is very religion/cult.  I have a bridge I'll sell you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You plan on siting that bridge?  We all know your lies are rooted solely in hate in bigotry. No one is cutting off anything from children. You weirdos just vomit that propaganda to soothe the fact that you are nothing but weird bigots.

[The promise he did keep is that the U.S. government is now collecting billions in tariff revenue—at a pace not seen in decades.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxvson/)
&gt;Not since just before the Great Depression
&gt;&gt;In 1930 the House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of... Anyone?The Great Depression.  Passed the... anyone?  The Holly-Smoot Tariff Act.  Which raised or lowered?  Raised tariffs in an effort to collect more government revenue.  Did it work? 
 Anyone know the effects?  It did not work and the United States sank deeper into the Depression.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Truth! In fact many economists are saying it was tariffs that caused the Great Depression in the first place, they say if nothing else they impacted it.

[Trump is so much better than Biden.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTwitterAccounts/comments/1kphwri/promises_kept_really/msxvrj9/)
&gt;Good way to tell if someone if someone is a real moron and not just pretending is when they say things like this.
&gt;&gt;By telling the truth? You’re the modern day equivalent of the old man who tells kids to stay off his lawn. Good job libtard.  Lmfao.
&gt;&gt;&gt;You gave subjective opinion, what does that have to do with truth? Lmfao.  How are you people so dumb?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Opinions can also be true. I know, it’s wild to think. But I wouldn’t expect Dems/Libs to understand facts. You just argue on emotion and feefees, and call anyone that doesn’t agree with you Nazis. Lmfao.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You’ve twice implied someone who isn’t even American is just on the opposite political team than you. Nothing I’ve said has implied any political affiliation…This is how I know you’re objectively stupid, you make baseless assumptions. Lmfao  Americas credit rating was just downgraded too.

Last March proved to be [the Netherlands’ **driest and hottest**](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/03/march-2025-was-the-sunniest-and-driest-in-the-dutch-record-books/) on record. A couple monthly heat records [were set](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906330571594187165) around the Bay of Bengal, some [nighttime highs in March](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906285274050543985) were broken across India, and [we came close](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906302934926737424) to a **record cold March temperature in Antarctica**. [Flooding](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/01/severe-storms-cause-flooding-and-destruction-on-greek-islands-of-mykonos-and-paros) on some Greek islands lasted a couple days, but did not result in any human deaths. Madrid meanwhile [hit **920% of its average March rainfall**](https://x.com/WxNB_/status/1906770538707796472), while Morocco [suffered from Drought](https://archive.ph/DKtFd) and locusts.  

An interesting [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1695) in *Science Advances* reports that inland waters have been experiencing a progressively worsening phenomenon relating to “**oxygen turnover**” caused by a variety of human factors: dams, climate change, and fertilizer runoff. Most inland bodies of water are producing more oxygen than they did in 1900 (much more, perhaps 4x as much)—but are also consuming much more (more than 3x) than they used to. The net result is that these bodies of water have become **bigger oxygen sinks**, thereby endangering marine animals and damaging water quality. 

**Damage report** from Myanmar’s 7.7 earthquake on 28 March: [3,838+ have been confirmed dead](https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-earthquake-rapid-assessment-impact-needs-response-and-conflict-3-april-2025) in Myanmar; plus [21 deaths](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rl9x6zqgo) in Thailand. A number of major bridges around Mandalay have Collapsed, and 37 °C (100 °F) temperatures, alongside mosquitoes, add to the misery. “**The smell of the dead bodies** has overwhelmed the town,” [one observer recounted](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/asia/myanmar-earthquake-sagaing-aid-intl-hnk-dst/index.html). The central government is busy with combating a patchwork of rebel factions that, combined, hold about half of the country’s territory—and the rebels are too poor &amp; disorganized to respond at scale. Until last Thursday, government forces were [still launching airstrikes](https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-actions-compound-dire-humanitarian-situation-aftermath-deadly-earthquake) raiding villages, and forcibly conscripting the unlucky, but they recently agreed to a 3-week ceasefire. USAID is [largely absent](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grl7nydyzo). **Food** [remains the top priority](https://reliefweb.int/report/thailand/food-cuts-and-earthquake-bring-double-devastation-children-thai-refugee-camps-save-children) for most of the affected people, and the military junta is [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/myanmar-earthquake-junta-accused-blocking-aid) of appropriating over half of some incoming humanitarian aid. Some major aid partners have [already run out](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250319-myanmar-relief-camps-receive-last-wfp-aid-as-cuts-begin) of funding &amp; supplies. 

What happens when invasive species take over completely. In the Hawai’an island of Oahu, [some forests have experienced the **total displacement of native species**](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250403-the-new-hawaiian-freakosystem-emerging-on-oahu-accidentally-created-by-humans) to tropical foreign species—what some ecologists call “**freakosystems**.” Meanwhile, a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-95582-x) found an invasive bamboo has established itself in the wild in Poland, along with the giant miscanthus plant.

1,900+ [scientists signed an open letter](https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-letter-warning-trump.html) condemning the Trump Administration's large cuts to scientific research and investment. The letter comes just as [a *Nature* poll](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00938-y) (with about 1,600 scientist responses) announced that 75% of scientists (particularly early-career professionals) are reportedly **considering leaving the United States**. Other [scientists are writing &amp; warning](https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/5/1/kgaf011/8099165?login=true) about fossil fuels and climate change, but nobody is listening. If scientists spent as much time actively marketing &amp; advertising their work as they do researching, perhaps people would pay attention more.

Scientists are warning about [the **weakening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current**](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-world-powerful-ocean-current.html), currently earth’s strongest ocean current. The strength of this current is important, because it keeps cold water flowing in the Southern Ocean. It is projected to **weaken by 20% by 2050**, which could invite warmer waters (and pollutants) farther south, hastening the melting of Antarctica, with all the attendant consequences. [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01669-5) which came out last week suggests that a warming Southern Ocean will result in greater rainfall in wetter summers in East Asia &amp; wetter winters on the west coast of the U.S.

And another [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JC021873)’s lead author says that [the **Beaufort Gyre is weakening**](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-thinner-arctic-sea-ice-affect.html) in the Arctic Ocean above Canada, which will eventually release freshwater outside the region and will probably impact the AMOC. 

El Niño events have been getting longer and longer—and [a study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01670-y) from *Nature Geoscience* says this one isn’t humanity’s fault; it’s been part of an ongoing process for some 7,000 years, mostly as a result of earth’s changing orbit. The implications include increased sea surface temperatures &amp; storms in parts of the Pacific, while other regions will receive Droughts. Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice [hit **new record lows**](https://zacklabe.com/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration/) for this time of the year.

A [holistic macroeconomic study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adbd58) on global warming’s impact on the economy warns that a 3 °C rise could result in a 40% loss of the world economy—when factoring in declines in worker productivity due to rising temperatures &amp; heat waves; mass migration disrupting everything; the spread of diseases; the impact on agriculture; etc. The researchers write that “it is the impact of global warming on the frequency, magnitude and duration of extreme events that is likely to have the greatest effect on systems.”

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581825000539?via%3Dihub#sec0080) on Quebec tree ring rises over the last 195 years found **decreasing snowpack since the late 1930s**. Scientists say that roughly [1,430 bird species have been made extinct](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/bird-species-extinction-human-activity/) by humans, though the true number may be around 2,000. Brisbane’s 2032 Olympic Games has [had its Olympic contract altered](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-brisbane-longer-legally-bound-climate.html) to loosen the obligation on being “climate positive,” changed to simply “aiming at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits.” 

Several locations in Mexico [set **new March heat records**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906946800033894562) on the last day of the month. Northern Michigan experienced [its **worst ice storm**](https://eu.petoskeynews.com/story/weather/2025/04/03/a-generational-storm-national-weather-senorthern-michigan-ice-storm-2025-was-worst-in-over-100-years/82779670007/) **in 100+ years**. Tornadoes and storms in the U.S. [killed 7](https://news.sky.com/story/seven-killed-as-thunderstorms-and-tornadoes-rip-through-us-states-13341376) last week. Togo tied its [hottest day in history](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1908588180540109255) (44 °C, or 111 °F). There is [a **heat wave** stretching](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1908452283781926959) through much of Asia—[after Europe](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1907823509210100033)—at the moment.

The IUCN Red List [says](https://earth.org/nearly-1-in-3-studied-fungi-threatened-with-extinction-from-deforestation-climate-change/) that about **one third of all fungi species are in danger of going extinct** as a result of worsening deforestation. Armenia recently ended [its **driest winter**](https://armenpress.am/en/article/1216302) in 90 years. And a [landslide in Indonesia](https://archive.ph/sKY1o) killed 10.

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025001771?via%3Dihub) from India determined that air pollution plays a strong role in mortalities during heat waves. The **convergence of these two factors** is particularly powerful “beyond the 75th percentile of temperature” and illustrates the interconnected (and unavoidable) nature of this predicament…and that’s not to mention the role humidity plays as well.

A deeper look into Africa’s [Harmattan wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmattan) indicates that [it is also carrying **airborne disease**](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-west-africa-hazardous-harmattan-disease.html), along with its greater-than-expected quantities of dust and particulate. 

[New research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c12007) on **underwater landslides**—termed “**turbidity currents**”—found that these landslides are channels through which large quantities of pollution, including microplastics, find their way into the deep, deep sea. The study claims there are over 5000 such pathways bringing sediment deeper into the ocean.

“**Liberation Day**” (the beginning of Trump’s large-and-wide-scale tariffs) arrived on Wednesday, and [economists are already sweating](https://archive.ph/rtVxG) over the implications. A baseline of 10% tariffs have been imposed on all non-American products entering the U.S., with [60 other countries](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/business/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-countries-list-dg/index.html) facing higher tariffs, based on a crude analysis of trade deficits with the U.S. Many countries, such [as China](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/04/china-announce-levy-on-us-imports-in-retaliation-to-donald-trump-trade-war-tariffs), have retaliated with their own tariffs—sometimes [in solidarity with regional adversaries](https://archive.ph/IVLY2). The [EU is adding its own tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/01/eu-has-a-strong-plan-to-retaliate-on-trump-tariffs-says-von-der-leyen), and is reportedly considering more. Stocks [are falling](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1jqt6ms/stock_market_recap_for_thursday_april_3_2025/) as **financial fear spreads**. This may only be the beginning. [Anti-Trump protests](https://news.sky.com/story/tariffs-latest-risk-of-global-recession-up-to-60-biggest-bank-in-us-says-in-there-will-be-blood-tax-hike-warning-13209921) erupted across the U.S. on Saturday. 

**HIV cases** [**have risen over 600%** in Egypt](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/new-report-warns-escalating-hiv-epidemic-across-middle-east-and-north-africa) since 2010, and over 110% across the MENA region. Scientists [warn about the risk](https://scitechdaily.com/raw-milk-and-bird-flu-the-risk-most-americans-dont-know-about/) of drinking raw milk, which could transmit **bird flu**. Experts [remain concerned](https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232) over the possibility of H-H transmission of bird flu in the future.

In a moment of good news, a team of researchers may have [found a way](https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-scientists-pioneer-method-tackle-forever-chemicals) to convert/recycle PFAS chemicals into graphene using “**flash Joule heating**.” [Another new strain of COVID](https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237) seems to be taking over: **LP.8.1**. Experts say it does not pose an increased risk. Meanwhile, [recent research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57849-9) indicates that pregnant women seem to suffer less from Long COVID, possibly because of immunological changes experienced during pregnancy. 

Another threat hospitals have been seeing more of are [**diverse fungal infections**](https://archive.ph/YdV3Q). The [WHO reports](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections) that very few new antifungal drugs have been launched in recent years. The full 140-page [report](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380836/9789240105539-eng.pdf?sequence=1) outlines the predicament of diagnosis and treatment.

&gt;“there are more than 6.5 million invasive fungal infections and 3.8 million deaths globally each year from severe fungal disease….and each year about 1.5 million people have invasive candidiasis or a *Candida* bloodstream infection, with almost 1 million deaths (63.6%)....There is also increasing concern with antifungal resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines…” -excerpts from the report, which is not really worth skimming

Samoa has been dealing with [**weeks of power outages**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/samoa-suffering-energy-crisis-after-weeks-of-power-outages), due to old generators and a worsening energy crisis for the island nation. Their annual GDP is expected to contract more than 15% as a result. Meanwhile, a [currency shortage in Mozambique](https://archive.ph/vAiKT) has resulted in a lack of bread and fuel. And a board member of a colossal insurance company [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/03/climate-crisis-on-track-to-destroy-capitalism-warns-allianz-insurer) that our climate is threatening capitalism—or it it the other way around?

Hundreds of thousands of [people protested Türkiye’s government](https://archive.ph/pLcGQ) last week, following a week of arrests and repression. Whether the anti-government forces can sustain this enthusiasm remains to be seen. In central Haiti, **gang forces** [freed 500 inmates](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05ek5gw0wo) from a prison; some of the released men are certain to join up with the gang-armies terrorizing the failed state. Gang fighting against multinational police [has become more common](https://archive.ph/6WHer) as they intensify efforts to seize all of the capital. 

A [photographic report](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgrj5rqnwo) sheds some light on Khartoum, the long-contested capital of Sudan’s Civil War, which was finally fully retaken by government forces two weeks ago. The [national museum has been nearly totally looted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/31/sudan-war-national-museum-khartoum-rsf-paramilitaries-looting-ancient-treasures-kush-nubia-pharoahs), and the whereabouts of ancient relics unknown. After years of waffling in the War, it [appears like Saudi Arabia has chosen a side](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/sudan-2671662242/), the central government. Meanwhile, **growing tensions** in South Sudan are [engendering the resumption of their civil conflict](https://archive.ph/zZgll). 

Niger [is pulling out of a multinational team](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/niger-junta-withdraws-from-lake-chad-anti-islamist-force) of soldiers fighting Islamist forces in order “to reinforce **security for oil sites**” in the country—[Niger is also focusing on expanding mining](https://www.dw.com/en/sahel-juntas-drive-new-era-in-mineral-extraction/a-72124570) in its volatile northern regions. [Tensions are growing](https://archive.ph/fqI9S) between Algeria and Mali after Algeria shot down a Malian surveillance drone in Algeria’s airspace. Hungary announced that [they are **withdrawing from the ICC**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/hungary-to-pull-out-of-icc-as-netanyahu-visits-hungary) on the same day Israel’s PM visited. 

Israel’s PM [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/israel-announces-intention-seize-large-areas-gaza-strip) that they are planning [to divide Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-morag-axis-what-we-know) by “**seizing territory**” in southern Gaza and isolate Rafah. The new security corridor is still taking shape, but analysts believe it will also bisect the humanitarian zone on its way to the sea. The import ban on goods into Gaza [turned one month old](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9lnl4xdqdo)—food and medicine is in short supply. In Syria, Israeli airstrikes [blasted two airbases](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27y7e2vk9o) which Türkiye was [said to have its eye on](https://archive.li/MaFUg), rendering them unusable. In Gaza, IDF [airstrikes reportedly killed 27](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4nlg6y5pxo) people in a repurposed school. In Lebanon, [an Israeli strike](https://www.yahoo.com/news/airplanes-fly-low-over-lebanons-004350588.html) killed 4, including at least 2 Hezbollah fighters. 

“The lives of hundreds of thousands of people here in eastern DRC are hanging by a thread,” [said one aid director.](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-millions-facing-destitution-violence-forces-people-flee-multiple-times). Over 1.2M people in the eastern DRC have been displaced since New Year’s, and many of their lives and livelihoods have gone up in smoke (in some cases, literally). **Cholera is surging** as a result of drinking contaminated water. The M23 gang army’s representatives [are meeting with government officials](https://www.africanews.com/2025/04/02/congo-m23-rebels-to-hold-direct-dialogue-in-qatar/) in Qatar next week, while M23 soldiers [allegedly move closer to the still-very-far-away capital, Kinshasa](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/the-battle-for-congo-m23-rebels-advance-towards-kinshasa) (metro pop: 18M). 

The Philippines is [**stepping up preparations**](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3304803/philippine-military-chief-warns-troops-start-planning-event-taiwan-conflict) for a conflict against China, assuming that they will be pulled into a War if/when China goes for Taiwan. Over a quarter million Filipinos work in Taiwan. American defense officials [appear to be pivoting](https://archive.ph/g4ZGn) towards the Pacific—but whether this is genuine resolve or just bluster is up for debate.

Europe is [preparing for a **potential War**](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-04/how-europe-nato-countries-are-preparing-for-war-with-russia/105116526) against Russia, with or without the United States. Germany has [stationed its first permanent troop detachment](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-launch-permanent-troop-deployment-lithuania-nato-eastern-flank-russia-ukraine/) outside Germany for the first time in 75+ years. Although there are only about 150 soldiers in Lithuania at present, the number is expected to eventually reach 5,000—although only 500 are planned to arrive by the end of 2025. One week after the Baltic states and Poland withdrew from an anti-landmine treaty, [Finland announced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/1/finland-joins-exodus-of-russian-neighbours-from-landmines-ban) that it is also pulling out so it can stockpile mines, for use along their border with Russia. 

In Ukraine, [**Russian airstrikes** hit](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/americas/ukraine-strike-zelensky-russia-latam-intl/index.html) President Zelenskyy’s home city (pre-War pop: 600,000), killing 19 and injuring 72 more—the most deadly strike on the city yet. Whether President Putin even wants a ceasefire [will be decided](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209w7g049wo) within weeks, according to American diplomats. Several people were injured as [more airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/06/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-criticises-weak-us-reaction-to-deadly-russian-strike-on-his-hometown) struck Kyiv last night.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ The International Maritime Organization [is meeting next week](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-nations-decisive-week-shipping-emissions.html) to discuss, among other things, whether to impose a **carbon tax** on all international sea-shipping. Sea commerce is theoretically supposed to become carbon neutral by 2050, and 3% of global emissions are currently made by sea shipping. A number of industrial countries, namely China, are opposed to a carbon tax, suggesting that a bullshit carbon credits system may be agreed upon instead.

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-It’s not so easy to **cut microplastics out of your life**. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1jpr8y8/wich_synthetic_clothes_should_you_replace_if_you/) attempts to do so through changing your wardrobe, but the responses are less than reassuring, since we eat &amp; inhale micro/nanoplastics as well. Microfibers are everywhere. 

-The subreddit has some very wonderful writers, like [the one in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1jpdxcr/i_started_writing_to_stay_sane_what_i_ended_up/) who posted a number of excerpts from a book of some 50,000+ words. That’s like 5 months of this weekly newsletter.

Last March proved to be [the Netherlands’ **driest and hottest**](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/03/march-2025-was-the-sunniest-and-driest-in-the-dutch-record-books/) on record. A couple monthly heat records [were set](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906330571594187165) around the Bay of Bengal, some [nighttime highs in March](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906285274050543985) were broken across India, and [we came close](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906302934926737424) to a **record cold March temperature in Antarctica**. [Flooding](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/01/severe-storms-cause-flooding-and-destruction-on-greek-islands-of-mykonos-and-paros) on some Greek islands lasted a couple days, but did not result in any human deaths. Madrid meanwhile [hit **920% of its average March rainfall**](https://x.com/WxNB_/status/1906770538707796472), while Morocco [suffered from Drought](https://archive.ph/DKtFd) and locusts.  

An interesting [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1695) in *Science Advances* reports that inland waters have been experiencing a progressively worsening phenomenon relating to “**oxygen turnover**” caused by a variety of human factors: dams, climate change, and fertilizer runoff. Most inland bodies of water are producing more oxygen than they did in 1900 (much more, perhaps 4x as much)—but are also consuming much more (more than 3x) than they used to. The net result is that these bodies of water have become **bigger oxygen sinks**, thereby endangering marine animals and damaging water quality. 

**Damage report** from Myanmar’s 7.7 earthquake on 28 March: [3,838+ have been confirmed dead](https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-earthquake-rapid-assessment-impact-needs-response-and-conflict-3-april-2025) in Myanmar; plus [21 deaths](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rl9x6zqgo) in Thailand. A number of major bridges around Mandalay have Collapsed, and 37 °C (100 °F) temperatures, alongside mosquitoes, add to the misery. “**The smell of the dead bodies** has overwhelmed the town,” [one observer recounted](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/asia/myanmar-earthquake-sagaing-aid-intl-hnk-dst/index.html). The central government is busy with combating a patchwork of rebel factions that, combined, hold about half of the country’s territory—and the rebels are too poor &amp; disorganized to respond at scale. Until last Thursday, government forces were [still launching airstrikes](https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-actions-compound-dire-humanitarian-situation-aftermath-deadly-earthquake) raiding villages, and forcibly conscripting the unlucky, but they recently agreed to a 3-week ceasefire. USAID is [largely absent](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grl7nydyzo). **Food** [remains the top priority](https://reliefweb.int/report/thailand/food-cuts-and-earthquake-bring-double-devastation-children-thai-refugee-camps-save-children) for most of the affected people, and the military junta is [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/myanmar-earthquake-junta-accused-blocking-aid) of appropriating over half of some incoming humanitarian aid. Some major aid partners have [already run out](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250319-myanmar-relief-camps-receive-last-wfp-aid-as-cuts-begin) of funding &amp; supplies. 

What happens when invasive species take over completely. In the Hawai’an island of Oahu, [some forests have experienced the **total displacement of native species**](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250403-the-new-hawaiian-freakosystem-emerging-on-oahu-accidentally-created-by-humans) to tropical foreign species—what some ecologists call “**freakosystems**.” Meanwhile, a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-95582-x) found an invasive bamboo has established itself in the wild in Poland, along with the giant miscanthus plant.

1,900+ [scientists signed an open letter](https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-letter-warning-trump.html) condemning the Trump Administration's large cuts to scientific research and investment. The letter comes just as [a *Nature* poll](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00938-y) (with about 1,600 scientist responses) announced that 75% of scientists (particularly early-career professionals) are reportedly **considering leaving the United States**. Other [scientists are writing &amp; warning](https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/5/1/kgaf011/8099165?login=true) about fossil fuels and climate change, but nobody is listening. If scientists spent as much time actively marketing &amp; advertising their work as they do researching, perhaps people would pay attention more.

Scientists are warning about [the **weakening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current**](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-world-powerful-ocean-current.html), currently earth’s strongest ocean current. The strength of this current is important, because it keeps cold water flowing in the Southern Ocean. It is projected to **weaken by 20% by 2050**, which could invite warmer waters (and pollutants) farther south, hastening the melting of Antarctica, with all the attendant consequences. [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01669-5) which came out last week suggests that a warming Southern Ocean will result in greater rainfall in wetter summers in East Asia &amp; wetter winters on the west coast of the U.S.

And another [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JC021873)’s lead author says that [the **Beaufort Gyre is weakening**](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-thinner-arctic-sea-ice-affect.html) in the Arctic Ocean above Canada, which will eventually release freshwater outside the region and will probably impact the AMOC. 

El Niño events have been getting longer and longer—and [a study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01670-y) from *Nature Geoscience* says this one isn’t humanity’s fault; it’s been part of an ongoing process for some 7,000 years, mostly as a result of earth’s changing orbit. The implications include increased sea surface temperatures &amp; storms in parts of the Pacific, while other regions will receive Droughts. Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice [hit **new record lows**](https://zacklabe.com/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration/) for this time of the year.

A [holistic macroeconomic study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adbd58) on global warming’s impact on the economy warns that a 3 °C rise could result in a 40% loss of the world economy—when factoring in declines in worker productivity due to rising temperatures &amp; heat waves; mass migration disrupting everything; the spread of diseases; the impact on agriculture; etc. The researchers write that “it is the impact of global warming on the frequency, magnitude and duration of extreme events that is likely to have the greatest effect on systems.”

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581825000539?via%3Dihub#sec0080) on Quebec tree ring rises over the last 195 years found **decreasing snowpack since the late 1930s**. Scientists say that roughly [1,430 bird species have been made extinct](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/bird-species-extinction-human-activity/) by humans, though the true number may be around 2,000. Brisbane’s 2032 Olympic Games has [had its Olympic contract altered](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-brisbane-longer-legally-bound-climate.html) to loosen the obligation on being “climate positive,” changed to simply “aiming at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits.” 

Several locations in Mexico [set **new March heat records**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1906946800033894562) on the last day of the month. Northern Michigan experienced [its **worst ice storm**](https://eu.petoskeynews.com/story/weather/2025/04/03/a-generational-storm-national-weather-senorthern-michigan-ice-storm-2025-was-worst-in-over-100-years/82779670007/) **in 100+ years**. Tornadoes and storms in the U.S. [killed 7](https://news.sky.com/story/seven-killed-as-thunderstorms-and-tornadoes-rip-through-us-states-13341376) last week. Togo tied its [hottest day in history](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1908588180540109255) (44 °C, or 111 °F). There is [a **heat wave** stretching](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1908452283781926959) through much of Asia—[after Europe](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1907823509210100033)—at the moment.

The IUCN Red List [says](https://earth.org/nearly-1-in-3-studied-fungi-threatened-with-extinction-from-deforestation-climate-change/) that about **one third of all fungi species are in danger of going extinct** as a result of worsening deforestation. Armenia recently ended [its **driest winter**](https://armenpress.am/en/article/1216302) in 90 years. And a [landslide in Indonesia](https://archive.ph/sKY1o) killed 10.

The **convergence of these two factors** is particularly powerful “beyond the 75th percentile of temperature” and illustrates the interconnected (and unavoidable) nature of this predicament…and that’s not to mention the role humidity plays as well.

A deeper look into Africa’s [Harmattan wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmattan) indicates that [it is also carrying **airborne disease**](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-west-africa-hazardous-harmattan-disease.html), along with its greater-than-expected quantities of dust and particulate. 

[New research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c12007) on **underwater landslides**—termed “**turbidity currents**”—found that these landslides are channels through which large quantities of pollution, including microplastics, find their way into the deep, deep sea. The study claims there are over 5000 such pathways bringing sediment deeper into the ocean.

“**Liberation Day**” (the beginning of Trump’s large-and-wide-scale tariffs) arrived on Wednesday, and [economists are already sweating](https://archive.ph/rtVxG) over the implications. A baseline of 10% tariffs have been imposed on all non-American products entering the U.S., with [60 other countries](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/business/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-countries-list-dg/index.html) facing higher tariffs, based on a crude analysis of trade deficits with the U.S. Many countries, such [as China](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/04/china-announce-levy-on-us-imports-in-retaliation-to-donald-trump-trade-war-tariffs), have retaliated with their own tariffs—sometimes [in solidarity with regional adversaries](https://archive.ph/IVLY2). The [EU is adding its own tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/01/eu-has-a-strong-plan-to-retaliate-on-trump-tariffs-says-von-der-leyen), and is reportedly considering more. Stocks [are falling](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1jqt6ms/stock_market_recap_for_thursday_april_3_2025/) as **financial fear spreads**. This may only be the beginning. [Anti-Trump protests](https://news.sky.com/story/tariffs-latest-risk-of-global-recession-up-to-60-biggest-bank-in-us-says-in-there-will-be-blood-tax-hike-warning-13209921) erupted across the U.S. on Saturday. 

**HIV cases** [**have risen over 600%** in Egypt](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/new-report-warns-escalating-hiv-epidemic-across-middle-east-and-north-africa) since 2010, and over 110% across the MENA region. Scientists [warn about the risk](https://scitechdaily.com/raw-milk-and-bird-flu-the-risk-most-americans-dont-know-about/) of drinking raw milk, which could transmit **bird flu**. Experts [remain concerned](https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232) over the possibility of H-H transmission of bird flu in the future.

In a moment of good news, a team of researchers may have [found a way](https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-scientists-pioneer-method-tackle-forever-chemicals) to convert/recycle PFAS chemicals into graphene using “**flash Joule heating**.” [Another new strain of COVID](https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237) seems to be taking over: **LP.8.1**. Experts say it does not pose an increased risk. Meanwhile, [recent research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57849-9) indicates that pregnant women seem to suffer less from Long COVID, possibly because of immunological changes experienced during pregnancy. 

Another threat hospitals have been seeing more of are [**diverse fungal infections**](https://archive.ph/YdV3Q). The [WHO reports](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections) that very few new antifungal drugs have been launched in recent years. The full 140-page [report](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380836/9789240105539-eng.pdf?sequence=1) outlines the predicament of diagnosis and treatment.

&gt;“there are more than 6.5 million invasive fungal infections and 3.8 million deaths globally each year from severe fungal disease….and each year about 1.5 million people have invasive candidiasis or a *Candida* bloodstream infection, with almost 1 million deaths (63.6%)....There is also increasing concern with antifungal resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines…” -excerpts from the report, which is not really worth skimming

Samoa has been dealing with [**weeks of power outages**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/samoa-suffering-energy-crisis-after-weeks-of-power-outages), due to old generators and a worsening energy crisis for the island nation. Their annual GDP is expected to contract more than 15% as a result. Meanwhile, a [currency shortage in Mozambique](https://archive.ph/vAiKT) has resulted in a lack of bread and fuel. And a board member of a colossal insurance company [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/03/climate-crisis-on-track-to-destroy-capitalism-warns-allianz-insurer) that our climate is threatening capitalism—or it it the other way around?

Hundreds of thousands of [people protested Türkiye’s government](https://archive.ph/pLcGQ) last week, following a week of arrests and repression. Whether the anti-government forces can sustain this enthusiasm remains to be seen. In central Haiti, **gang forces** [freed 500 inmates](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05ek5gw0wo) from a prison; some of the released men are certain to join up with the gang-armies terrorizing the failed state. Gang fighting against multinational police [has become more common](https://archive.ph/6WHer) as they intensify efforts to seize all of the capital. 

A [photographic report](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgrj5rqnwo) sheds some light on Khartoum, the long-contested capital of Sudan’s Civil War, which was finally fully retaken by government forces two weeks ago. The [national museum has been nearly totally looted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/31/sudan-war-national-museum-khartoum-rsf-paramilitaries-looting-ancient-treasures-kush-nubia-pharoahs), and the whereabouts of ancient relics unknown. After years of waffling in the War, it [appears like Saudi Arabia has chosen a side](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/sudan-2671662242/), the central government. Meanwhile, **growing tensions** in South Sudan are [engendering the resumption of their civil conflict](https://archive.ph/zZgll). 

Niger [is pulling out of a multinational team](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/niger-junta-withdraws-from-lake-chad-anti-islamist-force) of soldiers fighting Islamist forces in order “to reinforce **security for oil sites**” in the country—[Niger is also focusing on expanding mining](https://www.dw.com/en/sahel-juntas-drive-new-era-in-mineral-extraction/a-72124570) in its volatile northern regions. [Tensions are growing](https://archive.ph/fqI9S) between Algeria and Mali after Algeria shot down a Malian surveillance drone in Algeria’s airspace. Hungary announced that [they are **withdrawing from the ICC**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/hungary-to-pull-out-of-icc-as-netanyahu-visits-hungary) on the same day Israel’s PM visited. 

Israel’s PM [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/israel-announces-intention-seize-large-areas-gaza-strip) that they are planning [to divide Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-morag-axis-what-we-know) by “**seizing territory**” in southern Gaza and isolate Rafah. The new security corridor is still taking shape, but analysts believe it will also bisect the humanitarian zone on its way to the sea. The import ban on goods into Gaza [turned one month old](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9lnl4xdqdo)—food and medicine is in short supply. In Syria, Israeli airstrikes [blasted two airbases](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27y7e2vk9o) which Türkiye was [said to have its eye on](https://archive.li/MaFUg), rendering them unusable. In Gaza, IDF [airstrikes reportedly killed 27](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4nlg6y5pxo) people in a repurposed school. In Lebanon, [an Israeli strike](https://www.yahoo.com/news/airplanes-fly-low-over-lebanons-004350588.html) killed 4, including at least 2 Hezbollah fighters. 

“The lives of hundreds of thousands of people here in eastern DRC are hanging by a thread,” [said one aid director.](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-millions-facing-destitution-violence-forces-people-flee-multiple-times). Over 1.2M people in the eastern DRC have been displaced since New Year’s, and many of their lives and livelihoods have gone up in smoke (in some cases, literally). **Cholera is surging** as a result of drinking contaminated water. The M23 gang army’s representatives [are meeting with government officials](https://www.africanews.com/2025/04/02/congo-m23-rebels-to-hold-direct-dialogue-in-qatar/) in Qatar next week, while M23 soldiers [allegedly move closer to the still-very-far-away capital, Kinshasa](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/the-battle-for-congo-m23-rebels-advance-towards-kinshasa) (metro pop: 18M). 

The Philippines is [**stepping up preparations**](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3304803/philippine-military-chief-warns-troops-start-planning-event-taiwan-conflict) for a conflict against China, assuming that they will be pulled into a War if/when China goes for Taiwan. Over a quarter million Filipinos work in Taiwan. American defense officials [appear to be pivoting](https://archive.ph/g4ZGn) towards the Pacific—but whether this is genuine resolve or just bluster is up for debate.

Europe is [preparing for a **potential War**](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-04/how-europe-nato-countries-are-preparing-for-war-with-russia/105116526) against Russia, with or without the United States. Germany has [stationed its first permanent troop detachment](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-launch-permanent-troop-deployment-lithuania-nato-eastern-flank-russia-ukraine/) outside Germany for the first time in 75+ years. Although there are only about 150 soldiers in Lithuania at present, the number is expected to eventually reach 5,000—although only 500 are planned to arrive by the end of 2025. One week after the Baltic states and Poland withdrew from an anti-landmine treaty, [Finland announced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/1/finland-joins-exodus-of-russian-neighbours-from-landmines-ban) that it is also pulling out so it can stockpile mines, for use along their border with Russia. 

In Ukraine, [**Russian airstrikes** hit](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/americas/ukraine-strike-zelensky-russia-latam-intl/index.html) President Zelenskyy’s home city (pre-War pop: 600,000), killing 19 and injuring 72 more—the most deadly strike on the city yet. Whether President Putin even wants a ceasefire [will be decided](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209w7g049wo) within weeks, according to American diplomats. Several people were injured as [more airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/06/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-criticises-weak-us-reaction-to-deadly-russian-strike-on-his-hometown) struck Kyiv last night.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ The International Maritime Organization [is meeting next week](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-nations-decisive-week-shipping-emissions.html) to discuss, among other things, whether to impose a **carbon tax** on all international sea-shipping. Sea commerce is theoretically supposed to become carbon neutral by 2050, and 3% of global emissions are currently made by sea shipping. A number of industrial countries, namely China, are opposed to a carbon tax, suggesting that a bullshit carbon credits system may be agreed upon instead.

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-It’s not so easy to **cut microplastics out of your life**. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1jpr8y8/wich_synthetic_clothes_should_you_replace_if_you/) attempts to do so through changing your wardrobe, but the responses are less than reassuring, since we eat &amp; inhale micro/nanoplastics as well. Microfibers are everywhere. 

-The subreddit has some very wonderful writers, like [the one in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1jpdxcr/i_started_writing_to_stay_sane_what_i_ended_up/) who posted a number of excerpts from a book of some 50,000+ words. That’s like 5 months of this weekly newsletter.

**New Concepts**

* *Volcanoes can spawn in the ocean, and over time, create new land with each eruption up to two tiles away from it*

* *Coalitions: Using diplomatic favor, you can form Coalitions with other civs. They differ from alliances as they can be left whenever there is a reason to, and one coalition can have several civs in them. The civ using the most diplomatic favor is declared the head of the coalition, and can sway votes in the World Congress or for emergencies. Member civs may leave however if you break promises or collect grievances with them. Watch out, they might make a coalition against you. Coalitions can declare large wars together, as well as negotiate peace between members*

* *Treaties: A system like promises that uses more diplomatic favor and have more ground. You can form these with Diplomatic Service. They allow agreements between civs, like ‘Don’t invade this city state’ or ‘Stop building troops.’ Breaking a treaty can give you reason to end a friendship or alliance with a civ, and allow you to declare war on them for it. Some treaties can allow for a large tangled web of protection against other civs, and if war breaks out, you may create a world war*

* *Pledges: A system also similar to promises or emergencies, in the world Congress, you can pledge yourself for 30 turns to follow an objective, such as neutrality and not going to war, or not having any emissions or reaching no emissions by the end of the pledge. If you break a pledge, you lose diplomatic favor and cannot participate in the next pledge. Some other civs also participating in the same pledge might dislike you for that as well. Staying true to your pledge will double the amount of diplomatic favor you put into it or a special reward, such as a free tech or civic*

* *Blockades: A new feature for naval units to block overseas trade and movement of other units over water. At least three naval units with a gap between them of 2 tiles has the option to creat a blockade, and the chain can be as long as you like. Naval units gain flanking bonuses for each ship in the blockade. This can stop you enemy from getting reinforcements, gold, or just to be a dick*

* *Unions: Unions are a way to use diplomatic favor instead of war to get what you want. Using diplomatic favor, you can outright buy city-states and free cities for an expensive cost.*

* *Colonies: Colonies can be founded after the advent of Colonialism (Earlier for civs like Phoenicia, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Norway). They are cities founded on a continent different than your own. Settlers can found either Cities or Colonies. These differ from cities. They need less amenities to maintain and do not get loyalty from a higher population. Colonies give huge trade bonuses to your cities sending trade routes there. You can also choose the next tile the city gains via culture and queue up to 10 tiles. They also can collect more strategic resources per turn or double an amenity resource using a Colony Project. New cities founded after Colonialism on different continents gain a few quirks. They have slower growth and production, and need more support from your other cities to maintain itself as a full city. A Colonial Revolt can happen when a group of disloyal colonies on the same continent all revolt at the same time, and can form their own civilization, with the most populous city becoming the new capital. The Casus Belli for Colonial War also allows you to go to war with your independent colonies or capturing another civ’s colonies. Cities on other continents cannot join in these revolts. Some civs, like Mexico, Siam, Brazil, America, and Ethiopia have bonuses to resist or mitigate colonies from other civs. Other civs, like England or the Netherlands have bonuses of capturing colonies. You can also capture foreign cities on other continents and turn them into colonies, as long as you are willing to pay the price in grievances*

**New Wonders**

* *Notre Dame: Unlocked with Buttress. Temples provide +1 Amenities and gain a second relic slot* Must be built adjacent to both a River and Holy Site.

Thank you to everyone who read this far. This took me a lot of time to research, experiment, and write so I hope you like the ideas. I know that there most likely aren’t any more civs to be added in Civ 6, but I do like the idea of them in it, or possibly in future titles. There were several other civs I tried, like Austria, Haida, Frisia, and the Philippines, but scrapped them to make each of these 9 more unique and less like civs we already had. I had a a lot of fun learning about all these different people and their histories. I hope you enjoy these concepts as much as I do. 

TL:DR: Keep on living your best life with just one more turn, love ya guys.

Edit: I will now be following up this post with a sequel thanks to all your support and ideas. I will implement 9 new civs, more concepts, and more features. There is a comment below explaining this in more detail. If you have any ideas, go reply to that comment. Thank you.

Thank you to everyone who read this far. This took me a lot of time to research, experiment, and write so I hope you like the ideas. I know that there most likely aren’t any more civs to be added in Civ 6, but I do like the idea of them in it, or possibly in future titles. There were several other civs I tried, like Austria, Haida, Frisia, and the Philippines, but scrapped them to make each of these 9 more unique and less like civs we already had. I had a a lot of fun learning about all these different people and their histories. I hope you enjoy these concepts as much as I do. 

TL:DR: Keep on living your best life with just one more turn, love ya guys.

Edit: I will now be following up this post with a sequel thanks to all your support and ideas. I will implement 9 new civs, more concepts, and more features. There is a comment below explaining this in more detail. If you have any ideas, go reply to that comment. Thank you.

He took you by the scruff of your neck like a mongrel dog or school child and dragged you along, feeding you lie after lie because he knew you wanted to believe him, and thinks you aren't smart enough to check on him.

He has no respect for the truth, no respect for your country, and certainly no respect for you.

If one of your children lied to you like that -- disrespected, you so -- severe punishment would be at hand. If one of your friends tried to manipulate you with a pack of lies, the friendship would end. If your wife behaved toward you like you were a jackass, and treated you like an idiot for all the world to see, she'd soon be nothing but an unpleasant memory.

Are you really so dumb you believe it is legal in 'Democrat states' to murder an infant? That's what Trump told you Thursday night. In his mind's eye he sees you all goofy-eyed, drooling intellectual dullard, rife with hatred, and accepting his every word and he didn't even blush while doing it.

Wake up, he's turning you against your own country and getting even richer while doing it.

And remember, it won't only be Democrat women who will be denied healthcare, it will be your wives and daughters, too. Remember also, there was a time when all power was returned to the states and black people couldn't vote and gay Americans had no rights, at all.

See this from CNN -- Google each topic if you don't believe it --I dare you!

""Trump’s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states allow babies to be executed after birth, that every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were no terror attacks during his presidency, that Iran didn’t fund terror groups during his presidency, that the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that Biden for years referred to Black people as “super predators,” that Biden is planning to quadruple people’s taxes, that then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, that Americans don’t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that Europe accepts no American cars, that he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election.

Trump also added some new false claims, such as his assertions that the US currently has its biggest budget deficit and its biggest trade deficit with China. Both records actually occurred under Trump.

Trump on abortion policy after Roe v. Wade

Trump repeated his frequent claim that “everybody” wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states.

Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Poll after poll has shown that most Americans – two-thirds or nearly two-thirds of respondents in multiple polls – wish Roe would have been preserved.

For example, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April 2024 found 65% of adults opposed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe. That’s nearly identical to the result of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in July 2022, the month after the decision. Similarly, a Marquette Law School poll in February 2024 found 67% of adults opposed the decision that overturned Roe.

A NBC News poll in June 2023 found 61% opposition among registered voters to the decision that overturned Roe. A Gallup poll in May 2023 found 61% of adults called the decision a bad thing.Many legal scholars had also wanted Roe preserved, as several of them told CNN when Trump made a similar claim and said, “all legal scholars, both sides, wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended: Roe v. Wade” in April. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe. … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.”

It is true that some legal scholars who support abortion rights wished that Roe had been written differently; the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of them. But Ziegler noted that although “there was a cottage industry of legal scholars kind of rewriting Roe – ‘what Roe should’ve said’ — that isn’t saying Roe should’ve been overturned. Those are very different things.”

Trump on Democrats killing babies “after birth”

Trump repeated his frequent claim that Democrats will kill babies in the “eighth month, the ninth month of pregnancy, or even after birth.” Trump pointed to the former Virginia governor’s support of a bill that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions as an example.

Trump also said later in the debate that some “Democrat-run” states allow babies to be killed after birth.

Facts First: Trump’s claim about Democrats killing babies after birth is nonsense; that is infanticide and illegal in all 50 states. A very small percentage of abortions happen at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy.

According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks or later. (Many of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.) By contrast, 80.9% of reported abortions in 2020 were conducted before 10 weeks, 93.1% before 14 weeks and 95.8% before 16 weeks. Former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, voiced support for a state measure that would significantly loosen restrictions on late-term abortions when the fetus was not viable. Northam was not talking about infanticide. There are some cases in which parents decide to choose palliative care for babies who are born with deadly conditions that give them just minutes, hours or days to live. That is simply not the same as killing a baby.

Trump on his previous comments about US military members killed in action

Trump denied that he had used the words “suckers” or “losers” to describe members of the US military who had been killed in action, after Biden pointed to the remarks to criticize his predecessor’s record for veterans.

Biden touted his visit to a World War I cemetery, where he said Trump “refused to go” and told a four-star general it’s because “they’re a bunch of losers and suckers.”

Trump claimed the remark was “made up” by Biden.

Facts First: The Atlantic magazine, citing four unnamed sources with “firsthand knowledge,” reported in 2020 that on the day Trump canceled a visit to a military cemetery in France where US troops who were killed in World War I are buried, he had told members of his senior staff, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” The magazine also reported that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump had referred to marines who had been killed in the region as “suckers.” John Kelly, who served as Trump’s White House chief of staff and secretary of Homeland Security, has said on the record that in 2018 Trump did use the words “suckers” and “losers” to refer to servicemembers who were killed in action. Kelly told CNN anchor Jim Sciutto for Sciutto’s 2024 book that Trump would say: “Why do you people all say that these guys who get wounded or killed are heroes? They’re suckers for going in the first place, and they’re losers.” There is no public recording of Trump making such remarks, so we can’t definitively call Trump’s denial false. But the account of Trump’s comments does not solely rest on unnamed sources from the article in The Atlantic.

Trump on politicians using the term “super predators”

Trump claimed that Biden called Black people “super predators” for a decade in the 1990s.

“What he’s done to the Black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them ‘super predators’ – in the 1990s – we can’t forget that,” Trump said.

Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Biden never publicly deployed the phrase “super predators” or endorsed the criminological theory behind it (which held that there was a new breed of highly and remorselessly violent young offenders). Biden did, however, refer to “predators on our streets” who were “beyond the pale” while promoting the 1994 crime bill.

As reported by CNN’s KFILE in 2019, Biden said in a 1993 Senate floor speech in support of the crime bill that “we have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created.” And he urged the government to focus on the people he said were in danger of becoming “the predators 15 years from now” if their lives weren’t changed – “the cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally … have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity.” But Biden did not speak of “super predators.” Four years later, in a 1997 hearing, he noted that the vast majority of youth criminal cases involved nonviolent offenses and said, “When we talk about the juvenile justice system, we have to remember that most of the youth involved in the system are not the so-called super predators.” It was Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, who affirmatively used the phrase “super predators” as she argued in support of the 1994 crime bill (in 1996). She said in 2016 that she shouldn’t have used that language. Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported tougher sentencing and street policing and warned of “wolf packs” of young criminals roaming the streets – and he cited a since-discredited statistical analysis that was linked to the “super predator” theory.

Trump falsely claims Iran “had no money for Hamas” during his presidency

Trump claimed that when he was president, Iran “had no money for Hamas” and no money “for terror.”

“Do you wanna know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke,” he said. “They had no money for Hamas, they had no money for anything. No money for terror. That’s why you had no terror, at all, during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim that Iran had “no money for Hamas” and “no money for terror” during his presidency is false. Iran’s funding for such groups did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions on the country had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN earlier this month.

Trump’s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as “maximum pressure.” But Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. “So you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically – continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,” Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a transcript posted on the State Department’s website. Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups (though it’s unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements.

Trump on the National Guard in Minneapolis

Trump said that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 during the unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

“When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities. You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they’ve done there with the fires all over the city – if I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.”

Facts First: This is false. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz’s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.

Trump on the European Union’s trade practices

Trump, complaining about the European Union’s trade practices, claimed that the EU doesn’t accept US products, including American cars. “They don’t want anything that we have,” Trump said Thursday. “But we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.”

Facts First: It’s not true that the European Union won’t take American products, including American cars, though some US exports do face EU trade barriers and though US automakers have often had a hard time gaining popularity with European consumers. The US exported about $368 billion in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), federal figures show. According to a December 2023 report from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports — importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU’s Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro.

Trump on job growth during Biden’s presidency

Trump said of President Biden, “The only jobs he created were for illegal immigrants and ‘bounce-back jobs,’ a bounce-back from the Covid.”

Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during Biden’s presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct.

Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022, the US has added nearly 6.2 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under Biden, 15.6 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities.

Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. When the pandemic was more under control and in-person activities could fully resume, those industries faced worker shortages. The pandemic recovery included what’s been called the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffling, where people – for a variety of reasons – switched jobs or careers.

Trump on the Paris climate accord

Trump claimed that the Paris climate accord would have cost the US $1 trillion, that it was the only country that had to pay, and that China, India and Russia weren’t paying. Trump called the accord “a rip-off of the United States.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US would alone have had to pay $1 trillion as part of the Paris climate accord is wildly inflated.

As part of the Paris agreement, in 2009, the US and other developed nations, including Western European countries, committed to collectively contribute $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer, developing countries, predominantly in the Global South, adapt to the impacts of climate change like sea level rise and worsening heat. Developed nations met their collective goal two years late in 2022, but the figure has never been as high as Trump was suggesting – and the US has certainly never paid $1 trillion in international climate finance. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022. Trump is correct that countries including China, India and Russia have thus far not contributed to international climate finance. However, China’s position as the largest global emitter means many countries are pressuring it to contribute to international climate finance through a formal process.

Trump on Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor

Trump brought up an anti-Biden lie about Ukraine that has been a mainstay of both the 2020 and 2024 presidential cycles, plus Trump’s 2019 impeachment.

Trump slammed Biden for supposedly “telling the Ukrainian people” to “change the prosecutor, otherwise, you’re not getting $1 billion,” referring to Biden’s efforts to remove Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2016. Trump also claimed the Ukrainian prosecutor’s ouster was related to Biden’s “son,” referencing Hunter Biden, who at the time was on the board for a prominent Ukrainian energy company.

“If I ever said that, that’s quid pro quo,” Trump quipped.

Facts First: Trump’s claims are false.

Since 2019, Trump and his Republican allies have falsely accused Biden of abusing his powers while serving as vice president to get a top Ukrainian prosecutor fired, supposedly because the prosecutor’s probe into the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings threatened his son, Hunter Biden. This claim was never true and has been repeatedly debunked. Nonetheless, it is one of the most-cited talking points used by Republicans against Biden during any discussion about his ties to Ukraine.

In reality, Biden’s actions toward the prosecutor were consistent with bipartisan US policy, and was in lockstep with what America’s European allies were pushing for at the time. They sought to remove the prosecutor because he wasn’t doing enough to crack down on corruption in Ukraine – including at Burisma. The Obama administration, career US diplomats, US allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, and even Senate Republicans, among others, all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015. It is not clear how aggressively Shokin was investigating Burisma or its oligarch owner – or if there was even an active investigation – at the time that Joe Biden successfully pushed for Shokin’s firing in 2016.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senate Republicans led a probe to find evidence on whether Biden abused his position to help his family financially, but came up empty. As the 2024 campaign approached, House Republicans put these false claims at the center of their now-flatlined impeachment inquiry into Biden.","MAGA, got a minute? # MAGA, Trump looked you in the eyes and told you the most outrageous lies and foolishly you believed all of them.

As reported by CNN’s KFILE in 2019, Biden said in a 1993 Senate floor speech in support of the crime bill that “we have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created.” And he urged the government to focus on the people he said were in danger of becoming “the predators 15 years from now” if their lives weren’t changed – “the cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally … have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity.” But Biden did not speak of “super predators.” Four years later, in a 1997 hearing, he noted that the vast majority of youth criminal cases involved nonviolent offenses and said, “When we talk about the juvenile justice system, we have to remember that most of the youth involved in the system are not the so-called super predators.” It was Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, who affirmatively used the phrase “super predators” as she argued in support of the 1994 crime bill (in 1996). She said in 2016 that she shouldn’t have used that language. Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported tougher sentencing and street policing and warned of “wolf packs” of young criminals roaming the streets – and he cited a since-discredited statistical analysis that was linked to the “super predator” theory.

Trump falsely claims Iran “had no money for Hamas” during his presidency

Trump claimed that when he was president, Iran “had no money for Hamas” and no money “for terror.”

“Do you wanna know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke,” he said. “They had no money for Hamas, they had no money for anything. No money for terror. That’s why you had no terror, at all, during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim that Iran had “no money for Hamas” and “no money for terror” during his presidency is false. Iran’s funding for such groups did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions on the country had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN earlier this month.

Trump’s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as “maximum pressure.” But Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. “So you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically – continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,” Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a transcript posted on the State Department’s website. Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups (though it’s unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements.

Trump on the National Guard in Minneapolis

Trump said that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 during the unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

“When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities. You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they’ve done there with the fires all over the city – if I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.”

Facts First: This is false. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz’s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.

Trump on the European Union’s trade practices

Trump, complaining about the European Union’s trade practices, claimed that the EU doesn’t accept US products, including American cars. “They don’t want anything that we have,” Trump said Thursday. “But we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.”

Facts First: It’s not true that the European Union won’t take American products, including American cars, though some US exports do face EU trade barriers and though US automakers have often had a hard time gaining popularity with European consumers. The US exported about $368 billion in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), federal figures show. According to a December 2023 report from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports — importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU’s Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro.

Trump on job growth during Biden’s presidency

Trump said of President Biden, “The only jobs he created were for illegal immigrants and ‘bounce-back jobs,’ a bounce-back from the Covid.”

Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during Biden’s presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct.

Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022, the US has added nearly 6.2 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under Biden, 15.6 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities.

Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. When the pandemic was more under control and in-person activities could fully resume, those industries faced worker shortages. The pandemic recovery included what’s been called the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffling, where people – for a variety of reasons – switched jobs or careers.

Trump on the Paris climate accord

Trump claimed that the Paris climate accord would have cost the US $1 trillion, that it was the only country that had to pay, and that China, India and Russia weren’t paying. Trump called the accord “a rip-off of the United States.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US would alone have had to pay $1 trillion as part of the Paris climate accord is wildly inflated.

As part of the Paris agreement, in 2009, the US and other developed nations, including Western European countries, committed to collectively contribute $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer, developing countries, predominantly in the Global South, adapt to the impacts of climate change like sea level rise and worsening heat. Developed nations met their collective goal two years late in 2022, but the figure has never been as high as Trump was suggesting – and the US has certainly never paid $1 trillion in international climate finance. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022. Trump is correct that countries including China, India and Russia have thus far not contributed to international climate finance. However, China’s position as the largest global emitter means many countries are pressuring it to contribute to international climate finance through a formal process.

Trump on Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor

Trump brought up an anti-Biden lie about Ukraine that has been a mainstay of both the 2020 and 2024 presidential cycles, plus Trump’s 2019 impeachment.

Trump slammed Biden for supposedly “telling the Ukrainian people” to “change the prosecutor, otherwise, you’re not getting $1 billion,” referring to Biden’s efforts to remove Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2016. Trump also claimed the Ukrainian prosecutor’s ouster was related to Biden’s “son,” referencing Hunter Biden, who at the time was on the board for a prominent Ukrainian energy company.

“If I ever said that, that’s quid pro quo,” Trump quipped.

Facts First: Trump’s claims are false.

Since 2019, Trump and his Republican allies have falsely accused Biden of abusing his powers while serving as vice president to get a top Ukrainian prosecutor fired, supposedly because the prosecutor’s probe into the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings threatened his son, Hunter Biden. This claim was never true and has been repeatedly debunked. Nonetheless, it is one of the most-cited talking points used by Republicans against Biden during any discussion about his ties to Ukraine.

In reality, Biden’s actions toward the prosecutor were consistent with bipartisan US policy, and was in lockstep with what America’s European allies were pushing for at the time. They sought to remove the prosecutor because he wasn’t doing enough to crack down on corruption in Ukraine – including at Burisma. The Obama administration, career US diplomats, US allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, and even Senate Republicans, among others, all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015. It is not clear how aggressively Shokin was investigating Burisma or its oligarch owner – or if there was even an active investigation – at the time that Joe Biden successfully pushed for Shokin’s firing in 2016.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senate Republicans led a probe to find evidence on whether Biden abused his position to help his family financially, but came up empty. As the 2024 campaign approached, House Republicans put these false claims at the center of their now-flatlined impeachment inquiry into Biden.",3038,LetterGrouchy6053,0,https://reddit.com/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1dr982t/maga_got_a_minute/,9,-0.9996,0.072,0.115,0.813,0.0337,-0.4829,Negative,20501

&gt;Yep, Obama 2009
&gt;&gt;It's 2025 and drug prices are sky high and Obama passed a health care plan to reform the system when he was president. I know Trump is not popular and this is just an executive order but if he backs the policy, I don't see what is wrong with this. Maybe adjust things so poor countries can have cheaper drugs but why should the US pay higher prices than Europe or Japan? If he implements a policy that fixes this...I don't understand why it would be so unpopular? Is this a wrong side thing?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you know why the ACA was so terrible?  It was because Republicans mauled it

&gt;Democrats have been trying to do this for a decade at least
&gt;&gt;Well hopefully they can work together to pass something constructive because it is a large issue in the US.
&gt;&gt;&gt;They did. There was a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act that started a mandate of controlled pricing for drugs through Medicare, at that time 10 certain drugs with the ability to expand, that was passed by the Dem controlled House and Senate signed into law by Biden. Once Trump became president, he neutered the department responsible for managing that control in pricing and removed its ability to do so.  Republicans trashed Biden when it passed and cheered when Trump neutered it.

[Liberals could never. Thanks President Trump!](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtms3q/)
&gt;What about the free Market?
&gt;&gt;funny how the liberals turn into conservatives when they try to argue with a good policy change 😂
&gt;&gt;&gt;Funny how conservatives are suddenly all for price control and socialism when the policy comes from a Republican.

&gt;if he does this man i respect him for it
&gt;&gt;same. some people want to hate him no matter what. this deserves praise regardless of your affiliation, tribe or cult
&gt;&gt;&gt;No it doesn’t, because he’s using an approach that won’t work, he knows it, so he can go “see? I tried.”  Not to mention, it’s comical seeing the party of small government become the party of big government and apparently regulation.  Just another of many many reasons the conservative ethos means nothing, stands for nothing, and is useless.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what's funnier is seeing liberals complain about cheaper drugs because a conservative did it

[I specifically remember hearing Mark Levin and other right wing talkers saying this was a horrible Marxist idea when even a mild version was proposed by Biden. Let's see them clean this up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmtva/)
&gt;Holy fuck, instead of celebrating this as a massive victory for the American people you cocksuckers instead find a way to sow seeds of division.
&gt;&gt;When there is a massive victory, let me know
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pharmaceutical prices being slashed? Is that not a victory to you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let me know when that happens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;God bless your soul bruh

[And yet Democrats trying to get Medicare and Medicaid to even negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies was a Marxist attack on capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtn80u/)
&gt;And here trump is attempting to do something you want you’re still complaining. Wow. Just fucking wow.
&gt;&gt;Opposing everything he does is what these people do. If he somehow miraculously cured cancer, these people would be complaining about that too saying how great cancer is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;He’s an idiot with no experience in science. He literally can’t cure cancer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The operative word was “miraculously”.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It would take more than a miracle for him to do any selfless act on his own.

[This dude sounds more and more like Michael Scott declaring bakruptcy.  I really don't understand how him demanding drug producers lowering prices will just magically lower prices.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmdtp/)
&gt;Wow dude use your brain
&gt;&gt;Enlighten us, O Wise One
&gt;&gt;&gt;Everyone has a common narrative of trump and they just stick with it. Even if he does something good for the people. Also, with him negotiating new deals, you dont think pharmaceuticals will be part of the deals just like the farmers benifeted from the uk deal? Everyone is so short term narrowminded these days. Obama and Biden said they would lower our cost but the cost actually went way up instead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Man, you guys really don't understand anything that has ever happened, do you?  Like, at all.  You also don't understand that Trump is not a king, and can't do this by executive order.  If he really wants it, Democrats in Congress will be very happy to work with him on the legislation.  That would be a real hoot to watch unfold...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just like he needed legislation to fix complex border issues

&gt;Yeah but then how will he put his name on it?
&gt;&gt;Bidens 35 dollar insulin cap was continuation of trumps 35 dollar initial isulin plan that took effect in 2021 with minor changes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then why did Trump cancel it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It wasnt canceled. Look it up rather than getting info on here.

""they will rise throughout the world in order to equalize"" ""the united states will pay the same price as the the nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the world""  why in the hell would i be satisfied with poor people dying? what the fuck is wrong with you that you ARE satisfied with that?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would you rather poor people or Americans dying?  I’m neither, but I imagine most Americans value another Americans life more highly than a person in Somalia. Empathy only stretches to what it interacts with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;never ever speak to me again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He’s right, you know. Alls this will do is make the drugs more expensive in Africa but slightly cheaper here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you work for an NGO in Africa? Send your money to Africa if you care that much but I care about my family, friends, and fellow Americans before anyone else. I even care about Americans who disagree with my views because we should always be united.

[Absolutely insane the pivot Republicans have made from market knows best to the President doing rug pulls with crypto and declaring, basically into digital thin air, that he and he alone can make drug prices lower.

&gt;You can’t have a free market when the rest of the world doesn’t have a free market on pharmaceuticals; that just called the US getting screwed over.  As with NATO, it’s time the rest of the first world nations start pulling their weight.
&gt;&gt;What the fuck are you even talking about? America has benefited immensely from NATO. They use our systems for munitions, they use our standards for training, we get the best intelligence and exchange of soft power literally in the history of the world. How you think it’s a loss because they’re literally not sending you a paycheck is like a toddlers level of thinking. Also, doesn’t touch how at all the Presidents dementia vibes on a particular day seemingly decides policy (that almost certainly won’t happen). lol
&gt;&gt;&gt;In 2014, all NATO nations agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense by 2025. You want to tell us how many NATO nations are actually living up to that agreement? Also, LMAO at “dementia.” You spent two years telling the world Biden’s mental incompetence was a “cheap fake.” As per usual folks, when a liberal makes an accusation, it’s really just a confession.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dog, how do we pivot to NATO on drug prices? Why are conservatives constantly doing this jump shit? I know you get a lot from Daddy Trump, marching orders and all, but are you getting the dementia too? That’s wild.  You better get back to the safety of his shadow while homeboy is still around before whatever neurons he has left degrade and he can’t even hit that Diet Coke button anymore. All this economic talk might hurt you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know you’re a bit dense, but let me try to explain in clearer: just as the United States subsidizes defense for Europe, we also subsidize their pharmaceuticals.  We are DONE subsidizing Europe’s socialism; they are now going to pay their fair share.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So now the socialism is the President unilaterally defining prices, immigration, and tariffs purely by his own power? Cause that fucking makes sense? 
 Just shut up and eat Trumps shit homie.

[Never mess with big pharma…](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmrp4/)
&gt;Didn't he undo Joe Biden's pharma negociation order only to come back with something similar and claiming it's his.
&gt;&gt;The Biden administration reversed or modified several of President Trump’s executive orders related to pharmaceutical policy, particularly those aimed at lowering drug prices and influencing manufacturing.  However, not all of Trump’s initiatives were undone, and some Biden actions built on or reframed Trump’s efforts.  Key Trump Executive Orders on Pharmaceuticals (First Term, 2017–2021)........
&gt;&gt;&gt;If EOs are not laws, the country should not be governed by EOs. There is a process for implementing laws, like the inflation Reduction Act. Trump doesn’t really want to be president, he wants to act like a monarch and issue edicts that he wants everyone to follow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know Biden came out issuing more executive orders in the first 100 days than Trumps first term, right?  Trump just learned from Biden.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lol! And remind me how many of Biden’s EOs were rescinded by Trump? EOs aren’t laws and can be rescinded in the blink of an eye, laws are not as easy to repeal.

[It means drug companies are screwed, poor people are screwed, and sick people are screwed. So short every pharma you can tomorrow.  Drugs are not priced the same globally. The US pays full price, while “evil socialist” health systems (e.g., UK) negotiate bulk discounts based on effectiveness of the drugs. Poor countries in the global south often pay incredibly discounted prices on lifesaving drugs because it’s better to save people’s lives over there than have a disease spread and kill people over here.  So if a drug company is selling the same drug for $1 in South Africa and $100 in the US, Trump is going to allow Medicare / TriCare / VA etc to only pay $1. 
 Drug companies are screwed because the US market makes up the lion’s share of their profits.  Poor people are screwed because drug companies will raise their lowest prices to save their margins in the US.  Sick people are screwed because they won’t be able to afford their meds at the new, higher prices pharma will set to save their US margins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmz78/)
&gt;Nope not at all. Executive orders don’t mean shit.
&gt;&gt;If the courts won't or can't stop him, they're as good as an edict from a king.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How does this king enforce such an edict? If I'm a private company and the president tells me ""cut your price by 80%"" and I say ""No"" then what's stopping me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How is a drug company going to operate in America if the FDA shuts them down? If the patent office blocks them from any new patents?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;God bless your soul bruh

[And yet Democrats trying to get Medicare and Medicaid to even negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies was a Marxist attack on capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtn80u/)
&gt;And here trump is attempting to do something you want you’re still complaining. Wow. Just fucking wow.
&gt;&gt;Opposing everything he does is what these people do. If he somehow miraculously cured cancer, these people would be complaining about that too saying how great cancer is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;He’s an idiot with no experience in science. He literally can’t cure cancer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The operative word was “miraculously”.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It would take more than a miracle for him to do any selfless act on his own.

[This dude sounds more and more like Michael Scott declaring bakruptcy.  I really don't understand how him demanding drug producers lowering prices will just magically lower prices.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmdtp/)
&gt;Wow dude use your brain
&gt;&gt;Enlighten us, O Wise One
&gt;&gt;&gt;Everyone has a common narrative of trump and they just stick with it. Even if he does something good for the people. Also, with him negotiating new deals, you dont think pharmaceuticals will be part of the deals just like the farmers benifeted from the uk deal? Everyone is so short term narrowminded these days. Obama and Biden said they would lower our cost but the cost actually went way up instead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Man, you guys really don't understand anything that has ever happened, do you?  Like, at all.  You also don't understand that Trump is not a king, and can't do this by executive order.  If he really wants it, Democrats in Congress will be very happy to work with him on the legislation.  That would be a real hoot to watch unfold...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just like he needed legislation to fix complex border issues

[Didn’t Biden reduce the cost of insulin pretty significantly and then he canceled the order, raising it again?

&gt;Yeah but then how will he put his name on it?
&gt;&gt;Bidens 35 dollar insulin cap was continuation of trumps 35 dollar initial isulin plan that took effect in 2021 with minor changes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then why did Trump cancel it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It wasnt canceled. Look it up rather than getting info on here.

[poor people around the world are about to have even less access to life saving drugs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtnu54/)
&gt;lol you guys can never be satisfied.
&gt;&gt;what? that is literally what he is doing.  ""they will rise throughout the world in order to equalize"" ""the united states will pay the same price as the the nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the world""  why in the hell would i be satisfied with poor people dying? what the fuck is wrong with you that you ARE satisfied with that?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would you rather poor people or Americans dying?  I’m neither, but I imagine most Americans value another Americans life more highly than a person in Somalia. Empathy only stretches to what it interacts with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;never ever speak to me again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He’s right, you know. Alls this will do is make the drugs more expensive in Africa but slightly cheaper here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you work for an NGO in Africa? Send your money to Africa if you care that much but I care about my family, friends, and fellow Americans before anyone else. I even care about Americans who disagree with my views because we should always be united.

[Absolutely insane the pivot Republicans have made from market knows best to the President doing rug pulls with crypto and declaring, basically into digital thin air, that he and he alone can make drug prices lower. Is Executive control over the market good or bad? How did I hear so much shit about Kamala talking about potential price controls for essentials, but now we have essentially a Maoist President whose sole economic prerogative is seemingly whatever vibe he’s feeling?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmtne/)
&gt;You can’t have a free market when the rest of the world doesn’t have a free market on pharmaceuticals; that just called the US getting screwed over.  As with NATO, it’s time the rest of the first world nations start pulling their weight.
&gt;&gt;What the fuck are you even talking about? America has benefited immensely from NATO. They use our systems for munitions, they use our standards for training, we get the best intelligence and exchange of soft power literally in the history of the world. How you think it’s a loss because they’re literally not sending you a paycheck is like a toddlers level of thinking. Also, doesn’t touch how at all the Presidents dementia vibes on a particular day seemingly decides policy (that almost certainly won’t happen). lol
&gt;&gt;&gt;In 2014, all NATO nations agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense by 2025. You want to tell us how many NATO nations are actually living up to that agreement? Also, LMAO at “dementia.” You spent two years telling the world Biden’s mental incompetence was a “cheap fake.” As per usual folks, when a liberal makes an accusation, it’s really just a confession.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dog, how do we pivot to NATO on drug prices? Why are conservatives constantly doing this jump shit? I know you get a lot from Daddy Trump, marching orders and all, but are you getting the dementia too? That’s wild.  You better get back to the safety of his shadow while homeboy is still around before whatever neurons he has left degrade and he can’t even hit that Diet Coke button anymore. All this economic talk might hurt you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know you’re a bit dense, but let me try to explain in clearer: just as the United States subsidizes defense for Europe, we also subsidize their pharmaceuticals.  We are DONE subsidizing Europe’s socialism; they are now going to pay their fair share.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So now the socialism is the President unilaterally defining prices, immigration, and tariffs purely by his own power? Cause that fucking makes sense? 
 Just shut up and eat Trumps shit homie.

[Never mess with big pharma…](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmrp4/)
&gt;Didn't he undo Joe Biden's pharma negociation order only to come back with something similar and claiming it's his.
&gt;&gt;The Biden administration reversed or modified several of President Trump’s executive orders related to pharmaceutical policy, particularly those aimed at lowering drug prices and influencing manufacturing.  However, not all of Trump’s initiatives were undone, and some Biden actions built on or reframed Trump’s efforts.  Key Trump Executive Orders on Pharmaceuticals (First Term, 2017–2021)........
&gt;&gt;&gt;If EOs are not laws, the country should not be governed by EOs. There is a process for implementing laws, like the inflation Reduction Act. Trump doesn’t really want to be president, he wants to act like a monarch and issue edicts that he wants everyone to follow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know Biden came out issuing more executive orders in the first 100 days than Trumps first term, right?  Trump just learned from Biden.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lol! And remind me how many of Biden’s EOs were rescinded by Trump? EOs aren’t laws and can be rescinded in the blink of an eye, laws are not as easy to repeal.

[It means drug companies are screwed, poor people are screwed, and sick people are screwed. So short every pharma you can tomorrow.  Drugs are not priced the same globally. The US pays full price, while “evil socialist” health systems (e.g., UK) negotiate bulk discounts based on effectiveness of the drugs. Poor countries in the global south often pay incredibly discounted prices on lifesaving drugs because it’s better to save people’s lives over there than have a disease spread and kill people over here.  So if a drug company is selling the same drug for $1 in South Africa and $100 in the US, Trump is going to allow Medicare / TriCare / VA etc to only pay $1. 
 Drug companies are screwed because the US market makes up the lion’s share of their profits.  Poor people are screwed because drug companies will raise their lowest prices to save their margins in the US.  Sick people are screwed because they won’t be able to afford their meds at the new, higher prices pharma will set to save their US margins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kkd91o/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/mrtmz78/)
&gt;Nope not at all. Executive orders don’t mean shit.
&gt;&gt;If the courts won't or can't stop him, they're as good as an edict from a king.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How does this king enforce such an edict? If I'm a private company and the president tells me ""cut your price by 80%"" and I say ""No"" then what's stopping me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How is a drug company going to operate in America if the FDA shuts them down? If the patent office blocks them from any new patents? If their drugs cannot be purchased by people on Medicaid, Medicare, etc?

When asked if the U.S. still wants to make Canada the 51st state, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded: ""I think the President has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state.""

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump: ""There are some places that are never for sale. Canada is not for sale and won't be for sale ever.""

# CROSSING YOUR BORDER HAS BECOME DANGEROUS

German tourists Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère were detained and strip-searched before being deported by U.S. border authorities in Hawaii. According to German media reports, border police handcuffed and strip-searched the women before detaining them overnight and eventually deporting them to Japan at their own request.[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)

U.S. border officials denied entry for Nicolle Saroukos, a military wife who says she was ""treated like a criminal."" Officials told her that she ""had too many clothes in her suitcase"" and ""because of that, they assumed that she was going to overstay her visa."" When told she would be denied entry, an officer said ""we're going to send you to a prison overnight where you will stay. Not detention center, he said prison.""[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)

On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee's US-Mexico border program, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he's never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this. ""It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.""[\[4\]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america)

# YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

There is no provision under U.S. law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,"" said University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert. Trump told reporters he ""loved"" the idea of deporting citizens to El Salvador.[\[1\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-wants-deport-some-us-citizens-el-salvador-2025-04-14/)

U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff cited horrendous living conditions documented in Salvadoran prisons, where inmates often lack access to proper sanitation, temperature control and even potable water. ""It would be a moral and legal travesty for the U.S. government to subject anyone to such conditions,"" Ossoff wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union has also described the concept as a legal nonstarter: ""You may not deport a U.S. citizen, period,"" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told NPR.[\[7\]](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador)

The Trump administration's actions have created a heightened level of fear and uncertainty for immigrants legal and unauthorized alike, their families, and communities. Even U.S. citizens have been caught up in arrests and fear deportation, particularly as Trump has called for removing ""homegrown"" citizens with criminal convictions to El Salvador, in a move that would be wholly unprecedented.[\[9\]](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-2-immigration-first-100-days)

Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's plea and his ad campaign, B.C. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon had a message for British Columbians: ""Hold the line. It's working. There's a reason why there's an ad campaign being run by the California state. There's a reason why there's ads being run by U.S. states. It's because Canadians have responded with a clear message: we're not a 51st state, we're not going to take this lightly, we believe all the tariffs should come off.""[\[4\]](https://globalnews.ca/news/11132762/california-ad-campaign-canadian-travellers/)

As one B.C. resident said about visiting Bellingham: ""A lot of us are simply scared of your border guards and ICE agents. There is nothing that a city or even a state can do to control them. So until that changes, a lot of us just won't visit, which is a damn shame.""[\[7\]](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bellingham-bc-travel-letter)

# OUR MESSAGE TO AMERICA

We don't want your coupons or your open letters. We want you to fix your country.

Your President has threatened our sovereignty, imposed punitive tariffs, and created a dangerous border environment.

Until your government changes course, not just your words, we'll be staying home and spending our money in Canada.

This isn't a temporary boycott. This is a fundamental shift in our relationship.

No discount is worth our dignity or our safety.

It's just not happening, Your Crocodile Tears Won't Fix This
A MESSAGE FROM CANADIANS TO AMERICA Canadians have sharply curtailed vacation plans south of the border amid an ongoing tariff war with the United States, a comparatively weak dollar, reports of travellers being detained by U.S. officials, and Trump openly musing about annexing the country.[\[5\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/california-governor-gavin-newsom-tourism-1.7511176)

# WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR DISCOUNTS

While California launches campaigns citing a decline in tourism because of President Donald Trump's policies, seeking to remind Canadians that they welcome us, telling us ""Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in D.C., but don't let that ruin your beach plans,""[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists)[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists) we have one response:

We don't want your discount codes and coupons. We want respect.

Despite Visit California acknowledging recent Canada-U.S. tensions ""due in large part to the ongoing trade dispute sparked by United States President Donald Trump and his administration,"" their message that ""you are missed, you are deeply valued and you're always welcome in California""[\[9\]](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/california-trying-attract-canadian-travellers-220828660.html) rings hollow.

Even as Bellingham City Council and Mayor Kim Lund write that they hope the ""peaceful partnership"" between Canada and Bellingham will continue[\[1\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bellingham-letter-bc-cities-1.7545411), they miss the point entirely.

# THIS ISN'T ABOUT ""HURT FEELINGS""

This is not about being offended. This is about being threatened.

When the President of the United States says he would wage economic war against Canada - and he's doing it - we are in a state of war.[\[5\]](https://abcnews.go.com/International/trade-wars-threats-annexation-trump-changing-canadas-election/story?id=121125965)

When asked if the U.S. still wants to make Canada the 51st state, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded: ""I think the President has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state."" Canada has also countered with a 25% tariff on goods imported from the U.S.[\[10\]](https://time.com/7280793/does-trump-plan-to-annex-canada-marco-rubio-51st-state-comments/)

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump: ""There are some places that are never for sale. Canada is not for sale and won't be for sale ever."" The exchange showed the newly elected prime minister refusing to budge on an issue that has created a swell of Canadian pride and fueled anger against the United States.[\[7\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/trump-canada-carney-tariffs-trade.html)

# CROSSING YOUR BORDER HAS BECOME DANGEROUS

German tourists Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère were detained and strip-searched before being deported by U.S. border authorities in Hawaii. According to German media reports, border police handcuffed and strip-searched the women before detaining them overnight and eventually deporting them to Japan at their own request.[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)

U.S. border officials denied entry for Nicolle Saroukos, a military wife who says she was ""treated like a criminal."" Officials told her that she ""had too many clothes in her suitcase"" and ""because of that, they assumed that she was going to overstay her visa."" When told she would be denied entry, an officer said ""we're going to send you to a prison overnight where you will stay. Not detention center, he said prison.""[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)

On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee's US-Mexico border program, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he's never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this. ""It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.""[\[4\]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america)

# YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

There is no provision under U.S. law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,"" said University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert. Trump told reporters he ""loved"" the idea of deporting citizens to El Salvador.[\[1\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-wants-deport-some-us-citizens-el-salvador-2025-04-14/)

U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff cited horrendous living conditions documented in Salvadoran prisons, where inmates often lack access to proper sanitation, temperature control and even potable water. ""It would be a moral and legal travesty for the U.S. government to subject anyone to such conditions,"" Ossoff wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union has also described the concept as a legal nonstarter: ""You may not deport a U.S. citizen, period,"" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told NPR.[\[7\]](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador)

The Trump administration's actions have created a heightened level of fear and uncertainty for immigrants legal and unauthorized alike, their families, and communities. Even U.S. citizens have been caught up in arrests and fear deportation, particularly as Trump has called for removing ""homegrown"" citizens with criminal convictions to El Salvador, in a move that would be wholly unprecedented.[\[9\]](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-2-immigration-first-100-days)

# THE RELATIONSHIP IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED

Canada's Mark Carney says relationship with the U.S. is changed forever. President Donald Trump's tariff war - and his repeated threats to annex Canada - are upending decades of close trade ties between the two North American neighbors.[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)

Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's plea and his ad campaign, B.C. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon had a message for British Columbians: ""Hold the line. It's working. There's a reason why there's an ad campaign being run by the California state. There's a reason why there's ads being run by U.S. states. It's because Canadians have responded with a clear message: we're not a 51st state, we're not going to take this lightly, we believe all the tariffs should come off.""[\[4\]](https://globalnews.ca/news/11132762/california-ad-campaign-canadian-travellers/)

As one B.C. resident said about visiting Bellingham: ""A lot of us are simply scared of your border guards and ICE agents. There is nothing that a city or even a state can do to control them. So until that changes, a lot of us just won't visit, which is a damn shame.""[\[7\]](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bellingham-bc-travel-letter)

# OUR MESSAGE TO AMERICA

We don't want your coupons or your open letters. We want you to fix your country.

Your President has threatened our sovereignty, imposed punitive tariffs, and created a dangerous border environment.

Until your government changes course, not just your words, we'll be staying home and spending our money in Canada.

This isn't a temporary boycott. This is a fundamental shift in our relationship.

No discount is worth our dignity or our safety.

EDIT:

1. I'm not saying this is good for the Philippines. Obviously it will have a negative effect on our exports to the US. My point is that this is being sold by Trump and the Republicans as ""other countries paying the tariffs"".

2. Sure, the tariffs MIGHT be partially absorbed by the exporter and/or the importing companies, but they won't be doing that for long, if they even do it. Remember, a business' main goal is to make money. And the only way they will make money is to raise prices. Heck, some businesses have already raised prices even if they aren't affected by tarrifs.

3. Yes tarrifs can be a way to encourage businesses to move their manufacturing locally, but what Trump is doing is just randomly dishing out numbers to random countries. There is no ""long term economic plan"" other than to grift and enrich the already super rich.


This is also why they passed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"". Raise the debt ceiling to borrow more money, slash taxes for the billionaires, and destroy public services.

Seeing the comments about overseas Pinoys mostly voting MAGA is very disheartening. You left the Philippines because of the rampant corruption, and that you thought there was no opportunity for you to prosper there, yet you actively want the same shit to happen to your new home countries.

It's time to do some self reflection.","So, Americans will pay an extra 20% or more for products from the Philippines. Got it.

EDIT:

1. I'm not saying this is good for the Philippines. Obviously it will have a negative effect on our exports to the US. My point is that this is being sold by Trump and the Republicans as ""other countries paying the tariffs"".

2. Sure, the tariffs MIGHT be partially absorbed by the exporter and/or the importing companies, but they won't be doing that for long, if they even do it. Remember, a business' main goal is to make money. And the only way they will make money is to raise prices. Heck, some businesses have already raised prices even if they aren't affected by tarrifs.
