#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  PSEi drops 4% in the final minutes of Friday’s trading day...** The **PSEi** finished closed Friday at 5,862 after a shocking last-minute 4% drop, pushing the PSE’s benchmark stock index back to levels that we haven’t seen since September 2022. Looking back in retrospection, analysts provided several reasons for the drop,including the **US Federal Reserve’s** “cautious” stance on inflation ([link](https://business.inquirer.net/504081/psei-nears-15-month-low)), rebalancing of the PSEi and its sister indices ([link](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/business/2025/2/2/us-unveils-sweeping-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-0826)), and the Philippines’ disappointing FY24 and Q4 GDP figures ([link](https://www.bworldonline.com/stock-market/2025/01/30/649999/psei-declines-further-on-gdp-miss-cautious-fed/)). Nearly ₱22 billion in stock changed hands, with ₱594 million in net foreign buying. On a sectoral basis, **Mining and Oil** was the hardest hit (down 6.6%), followed by Industrial (down 5.4%), and Property (down 3.7%). The only sector to gain was **Financial**, which increased 1.0%. The action was even more intense at the individual stock level. The only two notable gainers were the two PSEi inclusions, **Chinabank** [CBC 93.00 ▲38.9%; 1117% avgVol] and **AREIT** [AREIT 42.00 ▲7.7%; 944% avgVol]. The rest of the **“Advances”** table were illiquid playthings. On the **Declines** side, **Alliance Global** [AGI 6.00 ▼20.0%; 710% avgVol] and **San Miguel** [SMC 65.20 ▼20.0%; 792% avgVol] dropped 20%, which wiped away approximately ₱13 billion and ₱39 billion in marketcap respectively. Unfortunately, the rout wasn’t restricted to just those two stocks, as **Nickel Asia** [NIKL 2.17 ▼17.8%; 1230% avgVol], **Bloomberry** [BLOOM 3.43 ▼13.6%; 170% avgVol], **Emperador** [EMI 16.04 ▼11.2%; 579% avgVol], and **Century Pacific** [CNPF 36.65 ▼10.3%; 345% avgVol] all plummeted on big volume.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I’m up to my eyeballs in chats with fellow investors, analysts, and business owners, and while I have heard a consistent drumbeat of nervous and pessimistic FY25 sentiment, I didn’t come across anybody--except for economist Jonathan Ravelas--looking for that kind of drop on Friday. As per his explanation, “How can the market recover when consumers still feel the high prices. 70% of our economy is about consumption. Infra spending and election spending are your positives, and negatives like Trump tariffs, currency volatility and WPS issue. Will you be bullish?” I think this vocalizes the uncertainty that I’ve been trying to communicate for FY25. It’s not that I don’t see paths to growth, it’s that I see so much material uncertainty behind nearly all of the macro inputs. I’m not skilled enough to know how a trade war between the US and China, the US and Canada, and the US and Mexico will impact global trade. I don’t know how that will impact shipping and fuel prices. I don’t know what secondary effects will boil up, what new dynamics will emerge, and how those will impact things like inflation, interest rates, the US Dollar, and oil. I'm expecting the PSEi to bounce back today, but I'm going to be watching very closely to see how enthusiastic (or not) that rebound is, and where the buying enthusiasm is concentrated!

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Citicore parent sells 1.7% block of CREC to pump its float...** **Citicore Renewable Energy** [CREC 3.52 ▼0.8%; 14% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5f2fa9842714b4b7ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that its parent company, **Citicore Power Inc** (CPI), sold 153,741,000 CREC shares in a block sale. According to CREC, the block sale was one of CPI’s conditions precedent to closing the deal with Indonesia’s **PT Pertamina Power** (“Pertamina”), where Pertamina is set to take a 20% stake in CREC. Since the shares sold to Pertamina would count as non-public shares (due to Pertamina’s degree of control through its board seats), CREC’s public float would have fallen below the PSE’s minimum 20% if CPI did not complete this sale prior to the close of the Pertamina deal.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** We didn’t get any details on the price that CPI got for the block sale shares, but the important thing here is that this sale is less than half of the shares that CPI has committed to sell to clear the way for the Pertamina deal. They originally said that they’d sell 346.34 million shares, so after this sale, that still leaves 192.5 million CREC shares that CPI needs to sell. The stock is up 8% over the past month and up 30% from its IPO, but it’s faded over the past week and the market’s crappy vibes can’t be helping matters that much. I don’t have any fears that CPI will fail to competently manage its public float, say like **SP New Energy** [SPNEC 1.15 ▲0.9%; 101% avgVol] did back when it was suspended (and nearly delisted) when the SEC surprised the management team with quick approval of its share swap transaction. There’s no SEC randomizer here. CPI and Pertamina negotiated the terms and the timelines are known. They’ll make it to the finish line.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  JG Summit’s Olefins Corp on “indefinite commercial shutdown”...** **JG Summit** [JGS 16.16 ▼6.5%; 387% avgVol] 
[[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3c490c7f6033f4e9ec6e1601ccee8f59)] confirmed reports that it has placed its money-burning subsidiary, **JG Summit Olefins Corp** (JGSOC), on an “indefinite Commercial shutdown.” JGS said that it “continues to evaluate various options to mitigate the adverse effects of challenging market conditions and to minimize impact to JGS operations and business.” JGSOC has been losing billions each year since the pandemic, and JGS has been forced to inject massive amounts of capital in recent years to prevent JGSOC’s bankruptcy. In January of 2024, JGSOC opened a new petrochemicals manufacturing complex in Batangas, and at the opening, President Marcos said that the plant would “directly and indirectly employ 6,200 individuals”, and that the plant would “enrich our economy by ₱215 billion [in FY25]”. The expansion project cost US $1.3 billion to construct.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** It’s not exactly clear what JGS will do, except that it will attempt to sell its remaining inventory. JGSOC has been a terrible drag on JGS’s profitability over the post-pandemic period. This closure comes at a brutal time for the corporation, considering that it just began full commercial operations of the facility less than a year ago. I don’t have insight into the **Gokongwei Family’s** long-term plans, but I have respect for their willingness to shut it down to avoid incurring more losses. JGSCOC has a massive footprint in terms of both land and buildings, so I’m interested to watch and see what the family will do. Will they exit the business by selling it all off in one batch, or chop it up and repurpose the assets in a painfully slow process that could take years? Any JGS followers have any ideas? This is not a stock that I watch closely.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 195th day of 2025. July is 45% done, and we are 15% of the way through Q3. The year is 53% gone. PSEi is still locked in a fairly sideways band. It’s been 98 days since we last closed in the 5000s, but it’s been 249 days since we last closed in the 7000s.

&gt;  **PH:**  We have no scheduled events this week, but we have plenty of stuff to watch. (1) DigiPlus [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] is down over 40% from its highs, but it’s recovered 5% from its low and is now getting some artificial demand from that ₱6 billion stock buyback program. (2) Island IT [IS 0.07 ▼10.4%; 397% avgVol] is down 52% from its March 2021 price over its first five trading days, all with red candles. (3) Trump decided to give the Philippines a 20% tariff rate (higher than the original 17%), but President Marcos is scheduled to meet with US representatives sometime in the next four weeks. 

&gt;  **International:**  We get June inflation data for the US on Wednesday morning, plus jobs data on Friday.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** If I’m being honest, nothing has caused me to pull out my personal finance spreadsheet as quickly as the news that **Trump** is actively seeking to remove **Jerome Powell**, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, and replace him with someone willing to implement a 300 basis point cut. When the stock market is pumping. When asset prices are flying. What would that kind of move do to the US Dollar? What would that do to the price of gold? What will happen with US stocks? Rate cuts are usually pump parties, and those are well-attended by crypto and all of its weird cousins. But what will the near-term consequences be? What about the long-term consequences?

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DoubleDragon still pushing for industrial REIT...** **DoubleDragon** [DD 11.04 ▲1.3%; 18% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d9598ca7dd348e53ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said that it has completed the construction of a 5-hectare **CentralHub** warehouse complex in Cebu. The property company of **Edgar Sia II** and **Tony Tan Caktiong** said the project brings its total gross floor area to 1.5 million square meters, which is a “milestone” that is in line with DD’s goal of establishing a ₱24.8-billion warehouse leasing portfolio and listing the Philippines’ first ever industrial REIT. CentralHub is a joint venture between DD and **Jollibee** [JFC 227.00 ▼0.4%; 56% avgVol].
&gt;    - ***MB:*** As someone who has been searching for a dedicated cold chain and logistics play that I could invest in, I probably don’t need to tell you that I think CentralHub is a gem. That part (to me) is indisputable. DD seemed to think so, too, since they used a huge percentage of the proceeds from the DDMPR IPO on CentralHub. I’ve made a lot of noise in the past (even last week) about how badly the DD team has neglected **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.07 unch; 94% avgVol] shareholders, and that this focus on CentralHub, combined with their seeming refusal to inject CentralHub assets into DDMPR, just rubs salt in those deep wounds of neglect. While I still think that the DD team has basically abandoned DDMPR shareholders, I don’t want to see these prime CentralHub assets into DDMPR just to make DDMPR better. The DD team has plenty of retail assets in its CityMall portfolio that are actually better suited to blend with DDMPR’s existing portfolio. So, DD team, when are you going to actually do it? When are you going to list this industrial REIT? There’s been plenty of action in the cold storage and logistics space recently. The valuations are great. The trends are great. Don’t overbake this thing like Globe is doing to GCash. Let investors get involved before it becomes too heavy.

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  DigiPlus spent ₱117-M to slow the bleeding...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5cc1a9d01067bc96ec6e1601ccee8f59)] told the Exchange that it repurchased 3 million shares on 10 July 2025, kicking off a ₱6-billion buyback program after suffering from a brutal sell-off triggered by a proposed legislation to curb online gambling. The total amount of shares repurchased was at ₱117.74 million, with the price ranging between ₱37.20 and ₱40. PLUS ended the previous trading week down by 4.3%.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t think this buyback program has the “juice” to overwhelm motivated sellers. To put it in perspective, PLUS has already had several trading days this month with value traded figures in excess of ₱2 billion. At that level, this fund is barely three days’ worth of support. Now, true, those ₱2 billion days were exceptional in that they were the market’s reaction to the Senate’s proposed regulatory action, but what I’m saying here is that this buyback program is like a bandaid for a bullet wound. It’s not going to be enough, on its own, to solve this problem. Of course it will help stabilize PLUS’s stock price, but it needs to be deployed strategically to maximize the benefit because they simply just didn’t put enough cash in this fund to be careless with it. PLUS is one of the most actively traded stocks on the PSE, and it’s had a crazy amount of capital flow into it over the past year. I personally think this was (and still is) a buying opportunity, but there’s still a lot of risk here. I don’t have inside info, and I can’t predict the result of the political game between the President, the Senate, and the House on a populist issue like internet gaming. I think the government will have a hard time turning its back on all this revenue, but we heard the same arguments from PAGCOR about POGOs that it’s making now about e-gaming (that it’s essential to fund government programs, etc), and we all know how that story ended for POGOs. This situation is different, since there isn’t the xenophobic angle that always made POGOs such an easy punching bag, but it’s related. POGOs and e-gaming aren’t brothers, but they’re definitely cousins.

Sorry for that massive gap in delivery last week, I had some kind of virus that left me with a brain fog that robbed my ability to string sentences together. Literally. Not cool. 

Thankfully, I've put it behind me and it seems like the rest of my family got through it unaffected!

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 195th day of 2025. July is 45% done, and we are 15% of the way through Q3. The year is 53% gone. PSEi is still locked in a fairly sideways band. It’s been 98 days since we last closed in the 5000s, but it’s been 249 days since we last closed in the 7000s.

&gt;  **PH:**  We have no scheduled events this week, but we have plenty of stuff to watch. (1) DigiPlus [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] is down over 40% from its highs, but it’s recovered 5% from its low and is now getting some artificial demand from that ₱6 billion stock buyback program. (2) Island IT [IS 0.07 ▼10.4%; 397% avgVol] is down 52% from its March 2021 price over its first five trading days, all with red candles. (3) Trump decided to give the Philippines a 20% tariff rate (higher than the original 17%), but President Marcos is scheduled to meet with US representatives sometime in the next four weeks. 

&gt;  **International:**  We get June inflation data for the US on Wednesday morning, plus jobs data on Friday.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** If I’m being honest, nothing has caused me to pull out my personal finance spreadsheet as quickly as the news that **Trump** is actively seeking to remove **Jerome Powell**, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, and replace him with someone willing to implement a 300 basis point cut. When the stock market is pumping. When asset prices are flying. What would that kind of move do to the US Dollar? What would that do to the price of gold? What will happen with US stocks? Rate cuts are usually pump parties, and those are well-attended by crypto and all of its weird cousins. But what will the near-term consequences be? What about the long-term consequences?

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DoubleDragon still pushing for industrial REIT...** **DoubleDragon** [DD 11.04 ▲1.3%; 18% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d9598ca7dd348e53ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said that it has completed the construction of a 5-hectare **CentralHub** warehouse complex in Cebu. The property company of **Edgar Sia II** and **Tony Tan Caktiong** said the project brings its total gross floor area to 1.5 million square meters, which is a “milestone” that is in line with DD’s goal of establishing a ₱24.8-billion warehouse leasing portfolio and listing the Philippines’ first ever industrial REIT. CentralHub is a joint venture between DD and **Jollibee** [JFC 227.00 ▼0.4%; 56% avgVol].
&gt;    - ***MB:*** As someone who has been searching for a dedicated cold chain and logistics play that I could invest in, I probably don’t need to tell you that I think CentralHub is a gem. That part (to me) is indisputable. DD seemed to think so, too, since they used a huge percentage of the proceeds from the DDMPR IPO on CentralHub. I’ve made a lot of noise in the past (even last week) about how badly the DD team has neglected **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.07 unch; 94% avgVol] shareholders, and that this focus on CentralHub, combined with their seeming refusal to inject CentralHub assets into DDMPR, just rubs salt in those deep wounds of neglect. While I still think that the DD team has basically abandoned DDMPR shareholders, I don’t want to see these prime CentralHub assets into DDMPR just to make DDMPR better. The DD team has plenty of retail assets in its CityMall portfolio that are actually better suited to blend with DDMPR’s existing portfolio. So, DD team, when are you going to actually do it? When are you going to list this industrial REIT? There’s been plenty of action in the cold storage and logistics space recently. The valuations are great. The trends are great. Don’t overbake this thing like Globe is doing to GCash. Let investors get involved before it becomes too heavy.

&gt;- **[UPDATE]  DigiPlus spent ₱117-M to slow the bleeding...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 37.80 ▼4.3%; 73% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5cc1a9d01067bc96ec6e1601ccee8f59)] told the Exchange that it repurchased 3 million shares on 10 July 2025, kicking off a ₱6-billion buyback program after suffering from a brutal sell-off triggered by a proposed legislation to curb online gambling. The total amount of shares repurchased was at ₱117.74 million, with the price ranging between ₱37.20 and ₱40. PLUS ended the previous trading week down by 4.3%.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I don’t think this buyback program has the “juice” to overwhelm motivated sellers. To put it in perspective, PLUS has already had several trading days this month with value traded figures in excess of ₱2 billion. At that level, this fund is barely three days’ worth of support. Now, true, those ₱2 billion days were exceptional in that they were the market’s reaction to the Senate’s proposed regulatory action, but what I’m saying here is that this buyback program is like a bandaid for a bullet wound. It’s not going to be enough, on its own, to solve this problem. Of course it will help stabilize PLUS’s stock price, but it needs to be deployed strategically to maximize the benefit because they simply just didn’t put enough cash in this fund to be careless with it. PLUS is one of the most actively traded stocks on the PSE, and it’s had a crazy amount of capital flow into it over the past year. I personally think this was (and still is) a buying opportunity, but there’s still a lot of risk here. I don’t have inside info, and I can’t predict the result of the political game between the President, the Senate, and the House on a populist issue like internet gaming. I think the government will have a hard time turning its back on all this revenue, but we heard the same arguments from PAGCOR about POGOs that it’s making now about e-gaming (that it’s essential to fund government programs, etc), and we all know how that story ended for POGOs. This situation is different, since there isn’t the xenophobic angle that always made POGOs such an easy punching bag, but it’s related. POGOs and e-gaming aren’t brothers, but they’re definitely cousins. Hopefully (for PLUS shareholders) they’re distant cousins, like the type you see so infrequently that you need to do flashcards on the ride over to the dinner to remember their names.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 55th day of the year. February is 86% complete. Q1 is 61% complete. We’re 15% of the way through the year already! The PSEi gained 0.6% over the past week, but with repeated flirtations with the 5,900s, the way forward feels stressful and more uncertain than usual. The trade wars have been quiet but the 30-day “reprieve” on the sweeping tariffs against Canada and Mexico is coming to an end soon, and we might get some blustery posturing that really messes with the markets. Oh, and the US market just had its worst day in 2025 thanks to increasing inflation fears.

&gt;  **PH:**  Our calendar is basically empty, except for RCR’s dividend payment on Friday. 

&gt;  **International:**  There’s a bit of economic data on Thursday with the US Jobless Claims report, but it feels like other fears have taken center stage. The 30-day trade war reprieve ends on March 5.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** It feels hilarious for US media to be in such a panic about the market’s Friday sell-off considering their markets have been so hot for so long and are still near all-time highs, but I think what investors are scared about is the growing consumer belief that inflation will get worse and growing consumer disbelief in Trump’s ability to mitigate that inflation. If you remember back to our own inflation crisis, the BSP seemed more concerned with what people thought inflation would be like in the future than what inflation was actually like in the moment. With good reason. Both the BSP and American investors are worried about “secondary effects” that arise when consumers expect prices to continue going up, like a wage-price spiral (consumers demanding higher wages because prices are too high, and then those higher wages causing prices to go higher), or a shift in spending behavior (like trying to time purchases or put-off purchases). The bottom-line here is that inflation is not solved, and it’s important to operate with the long-term view that this is the “cheapest” that things will be. Except for stocks. Some can still get cheaper.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Keppel Philippines applies for voluntary delisting...** **Keppel Philippines** [KPH 19.98 ▼0.1%; 0% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ed281a2b757b2e0aec6e1601ccee8f59)], the past owners of **Podium mall** before its sale to **BDO** [BDO 142.00 unch; 31% avgVol], have notified investors that the company plans to voluntarily delist. KPH’s parent company, Kepwealth Inc (Kepwealth), intends to conduct a tender offer for KPH and KPHB shares at a price of ₱27.40/share. KEP’s board of directors approved the application to delist, but the initiative still requires stockholder approval and a successful tender offer by Kepwealth to acquire at least 95% of all issued and outstanding KPH shares. A special stockholders meeting has been scheduled on April 24.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** The proposed tender offer price is higher than the highest valuation from its February 13 fairness opinion and valuation report and the volume-weighted average price over the past year. There’s very little actual information on why Kepwealth wants to delist KPH, but that hasn’t stopped speculators from speculating. Some are saying that perhaps Kepwealth is dissatisfied with the market’s valuation of KEP’s shares, and are taking this opportunity to buy the company back at such a depressed valuation. In a related line of thinking, others say that perhaps KPH is planning to raise funds, and would rather raise funds privately at a higher valuation. Either way, KPH is essentially an illiquid stock that only has a single-digit number of trades per day on average, and this delisting felt like it has been in the cards since the sale of Podium to BDO and the subsequent 216% dividend. Back in April 2024, when KPH hit the ceiling after that dividend announcement, I said, “I wonder why KPH is getting so much attention now? Speculators,. mount up!” I was talking about what felt like a march toward delisting, and the unusual activity around the stock as insiders try to front-run that process. It’s such a gross sign when delisting plays are the most profitable game in town.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  BSP announces “surprise” 200 basis point cut to RRR...** The **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP) [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/banking-finance/2025/02/23/654958/peso-may-weaken-vs-dollar-on-rrr-announcement/)], our central bank, announced a 200 basis point cut to the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), effective March 28. The BSP said that the move was in line with its “long-term goal of enabling banks to channel their funds more effectively toward productive loans and investments”, adding that an RRR reduction will “lessen frictions that hinder financial intermediation.” The move is estimated to release between ₱300 billion and ₱400 billion of liquidity into the financial system.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** There’s a ton of nuance here and it’s easy to get caught in the weeds. I’m not an economist, so while it logically makes sense that RRR cuts should worsen asset price inflation, I don’t know for certain that that’s what is happening, and all the times I’ve talked about that in the past, I’ve received pushback from actual economists saying that the benefits to the economy outweigh whatever impact on asset prices any RRR cut might have. What I do know, however, is that RRR cuts are a massive gift to the banking sector. Such a juicy gift that, under a previous BSP administration, the then BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said that the BSP would “literally bribe the banks” with RRR cuts to waive fees on small bank-to-bank financial transactions that unfairly penalize the poor. He said that in 2023, when the RRR was 12%. Now, with this cut, the RRR will be just 5%, and what do we have to show for it? Predictably, our banks are generating record profits across the board. But hey, at least the elimination of small value transfers fees was totally worth it! Wait. What’s that? The BSP didn’t actually require banks to waive small value transfer fees? Is it still a bribe if you give away something of public value and get nothing in return?

&gt;  **PH:**  Our calendar is basically empty, except for RCR’s dividend payment on Friday. 

&gt;  **International:**  There’s a bit of economic data on Thursday with the US Jobless Claims report, but it feels like other fears have taken center stage. The 30-day trade war reprieve ends on March 5.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** It feels hilarious for US media to be in such a panic about the market’s Friday sell-off considering their markets have been so hot for so long and are still near all-time highs, but I think what investors are scared about is the growing consumer belief that inflation will get worse and growing consumer disbelief in Trump’s ability to mitigate that inflation. If you remember back to our own inflation crisis, the BSP seemed more concerned with what people thought inflation would be like in the future than what inflation was actually like in the moment. With good reason. Both the BSP and American investors are worried about “secondary effects” that arise when consumers expect prices to continue going up, like a wage-price spiral (consumers demanding higher wages because prices are too high, and then those higher wages causing prices to go higher), or a shift in spending behavior (like trying to time purchases or put-off purchases). The bottom-line here is that inflation is not solved, and it’s important to operate with the long-term view that this is the “cheapest” that things will be. Except for stocks. Some can still get cheaper.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Keppel Philippines applies for voluntary delisting...** **Keppel Philippines** [KPH 19.98 ▼0.1%; 0% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ed281a2b757b2e0aec6e1601ccee8f59)], the past owners of **Podium mall** before its sale to **BDO** [BDO 142.00 unch; 31% avgVol], have notified investors that the company plans to voluntarily delist. KPH’s parent company, Kepwealth Inc (Kepwealth), intends to conduct a tender offer for KPH and KPHB shares at a price of ₱27.40/share. KEP’s board of directors approved the application to delist, but the initiative still requires stockholder approval and a successful tender offer by Kepwealth to acquire at least 95% of all issued and outstanding KPH shares. A special stockholders meeting has been scheduled on April 24.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** The proposed tender offer price is higher than the highest valuation from its February 13 fairness opinion and valuation report and the volume-weighted average price over the past year. There’s very little actual information on why Kepwealth wants to delist KPH, but that hasn’t stopped speculators from speculating. Some are saying that perhaps Kepwealth is dissatisfied with the market’s valuation of KEP’s shares, and are taking this opportunity to buy the company back at such a depressed valuation. In a related line of thinking, others say that perhaps KPH is planning to raise funds, and would rather raise funds privately at a higher valuation. Either way, KPH is essentially an illiquid stock that only has a single-digit number of trades per day on average, and this delisting felt like it has been in the cards since the sale of Podium to BDO and the subsequent 216% dividend. Back in April 2024, when KPH hit the ceiling after that dividend announcement, I said, “I wonder why KPH is getting so much attention now? Speculators,. mount up!” I was talking about what felt like a march toward delisting, and the unusual activity around the stock as insiders try to front-run that process. It’s such a gross sign when delisting plays are the most profitable game in town.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  BSP announces “surprise” 200 basis point cut to RRR...** The **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP) [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/banking-finance/2025/02/23/654958/peso-may-weaken-vs-dollar-on-rrr-announcement/)], our central bank, announced a 200 basis point cut to the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), effective March 28. The BSP said that the move was in line with its “long-term goal of enabling banks to channel their funds more effectively toward productive loans and investments”, adding that an RRR reduction will “lessen frictions that hinder financial intermediation.” The move is estimated to release between ₱300 billion and ₱400 billion of liquidity into the financial system.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** There’s a ton of nuance here and it’s easy to get caught in the weeds. I’m not an economist, so while it logically makes sense that RRR cuts should worsen asset price inflation, I don’t know for certain that that’s what is happening, and all the times I’ve talked about that in the past, I’ve received pushback from actual economists saying that the benefits to the economy outweigh whatever impact on asset prices any RRR cut might have. What I do know, however, is that RRR cuts are a massive gift to the banking sector. Such a juicy gift that, under a previous BSP administration, the then BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said that the BSP would “literally bribe the banks” with RRR cuts to waive fees on small bank-to-bank financial transactions that unfairly penalize the poor. He said that in 2023, when the RRR was 12%. Now, with this cut, the RRR will be just 5%, and what do we have to show for it? Predictably, our banks are generating record profits across the board. But hey, at least the elimination of small value transfers fees was totally worth it! Wait. What’s that? The BSP didn’t actually require banks to waive small value transfer fees? Is it still a bribe if you give away something of public value and get nothing in return?

This is a holiday-shortened week (Eid on Friday), but it's not usually one of those holidays that traders bake into their travel plans, so I don't expect this to have much of an impact on the week's average daily trading volume.

That said, there aren't exactly a lot of catalysts on the schedule, so maybe the week will turn out to be quiet anyway, organically. 

Let's clip in and see what happens.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 153rd day of 2025. We’re 7% of the way through June, and we’re 69% (nice) of the way through Q2. The year is 42% complete. The PSEi is fading off of its short-term high two weeks ago, but I don’t feel a lot of “hope” on the market. I feel a lot of excitement for specific stocks, but not a lot of broad enthusiasm for the future that would make me think the market itself will attract the buyers needed to sustain a run into “higher highs”.

&gt;  **PH:**  This is a weird week. We don’t have anything on the calendar until Thursday, when the Philippine Statistics Authority will give us the inflation reading for May, and then the week is over due to the observance of Eid and the associated non-trading day on Friday.

&gt;  **International:**  There’s nothing on the calendar this week that holds a candle to watching whatever is happening between China and the US. After Trump was humiliated in public by the revelation that US market traders use the “TACO” model to plan trades (Trump Always Chickens Out), the US increased tariffs on steel and aluminum (hitting Canada) and accused China of breaching the loose terms of the interim trade war pause understanding, and even said that China poses an “imminent threat” to Taiwan. Commerce Secretary Scott Bessent said that talks with China on a full resolution are “stalled”.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** I’m not a huge historian, but I know enough about what’s come before to know that it’s a bad sign when two global powers “decouple” economically and politically. That’s the process that Trump’s sudden trade war has started, and it’s not clear how any of these smaller transactional moves (like the pause, or any shifting of the tariff levels) will reverse the direction of the process. From a high level, what Trump has already done provides China with no incentive to cooperate, so it’s hard for me to see a scenario where the two countries return to anything that resembles the status quo.

&gt;- **[NEWS] Robinsons Retail buys 22.2% of itself in block sale...** **Robinsons Retail Holdings** [RRHI 37.80 ▲3.0%; 497% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=189f34e9b4e6dee9ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that it used a block sale to purchase 315.3 million RRHI shares (~22.2% of its outstanding shares) for ₱15.77 billion. The per-share price was at ₱50, which was a 36% premium over RRHI’s market price before the block sale completed. RRHI bought the shares from **DFI Retail Group** (DFI), a Hong Kong-based investor in SE Asian retailers. DFI is reported to be “streamlining” its portfolio and will use the proceeds to support its subsidiary businesses. The amount spent on this “special block sale” comes out of the capital allocated by RRHI toward share buy-back transactions; there is only ~₱166 million left in buy-back allocations.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** This feels a bit like when Converge had to catch the bags of its American investor, when that investor suddenly decided to liquidate its Converge stake. The biggest winner here is obviously DFI, which was able to get a massive premium for its shares. They would not have received anywhere close to that price if they had tried to sell the shares on the open market; considering RRHI’s average volume is only about 500k shares per day, this deal would have taken three years to complete, and the constant selling pressure would have nuked the price. The primary justification for the deal from RRHI’s perspective is that it feels like its own stock is undervalued by the market, but it’s been almost 1.5 years since the market valued RRHI at anything close to the ₱50/level. If I was an RRHI shareholder (I’m not), I’d be thankful to have this block of shares off the market, but I’d also not be a fan of the price we had to pay to do it.

&gt;- **[UPDATE] FILRT mall asset injection approved by SEC...** **Filinvest REIT** [FILRT 3.18 unch; 66% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=820d35c1407d1bb3ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said its ₱6.3-billion asset injection, featuring the **Festival Mall** (“Main Mall” building), was approved by the SEC. The transaction was performed between FILRT and its parent company, **Filinvest Land** [FLI 0.73 ▼1.4%; 33% avgVol], using a property-for-share swap. The transaction increases FLI’s ownership stake in FILRT from 51% to 63.27%.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** This move was approved by FILRT’s board back in late January, approved by FILRT’s shareholders in early March, and then SEC approved three months later. Just over five months, door-to-door, is not bad but unless there’s a ton of activity going on between FILRT/FLI and the SEC behind the scenes that we don’t get to see, it feels like this SEC approval process is ripe for reform. I’ve been covering REITs from the beginning, and I don’t remember a single property-for-share swap that has been rejected by the SEC. While I recognize the “Chesterton’s Fence”([link](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/)) of tinkering with administrative processes, that kind of success rate makes me think that there has to be a way to dramatically reduce the lag time between submission to the SEC and final approval. Pivoting to talk about FILRT specifically for a second, this is a move designed to insulate FILRT shareholders from the underperformance of the commercial office sector. It’s a tangible move by management to diversify its income and improve some of its metrics, like occupancy, in the footsteps of the bigger players like AREIT.

&gt;- **[NEWS]     Century Pacific Food [CNPF 25.50 ▲2.20%] ventures into the pet food segment with new brand, “Goodest”...** The company known for its staple foods announced yesterday that [it will enter into the pet food business](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=efa9e0ca45cbdaeb5d542af6f1e997b9) with a range of products that will be released under its new brand, “Goodest”. CNPF’s Executive Chairman said that the move is intended to capitalize on the domestic and international growth of the pet food industry, especially considering the macro demographic trends that will likely continue to see incomes rise and the middle class grow. CNPF notes that pet ownership is on the rise in the Philippines thanks to the pandemic keeping people close to home, and the changing views of some Filipinos to regard pets as closer to “family’” rather than simply “animals”. Goodest products are available now in supermarket chains and online platforms in the Philippines, starting with its line of affordable cat food.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** *In the US, where the “fur baby” phenomenon is probably the most pronounced in the world, the pet food industry is worth over $70 billion in annual sales and grew 10% in 2020. Many of the products are incredibly high-margin, and are not complicated products to develop, manufacture, ship, or store. Pet food is a very online-friendly business. It also dove-tails nicely with several of CNPF’s other product lines, and the know-how needed to churn out tins of cat food at scale is probably really similar to that which is needed to do the same for its human-facing brands. The Century brand has sentimental value with consumers, and is increasingly associated with healthy living and healthy lifestyle; both of these brand characteristics will probably crossover very effectively into the pet food segment. I will wait to see how this segment actually performs (pricing and retail space are always factors that can cripple even the best product launch), but if I were a CNPF shareholder, I’d be pretty excited to see the company branching out into interesting new segments like this. Very interesting move!*

&gt;- **[NEWS]     Wellex Industries [WIN 0.25 unch] and Forum Pacific [FPI 0.29 unch] mourn passing of Chairman Peter Salud at 66...** Peter Salud was recruited by William Gatchalian a long time ago to assist in the administration of the growing Gatchalian group of companies. He was first elected to the board of FPI, the petroleum product and exploration arm of the Gatchalian Family, back in 1996, and to the board of WIN, the Family’s mining and petroleum investment arm, back in 2018. Mr. According to [this Bilyo article](https://bilyonaryo.com/2021/10/20/william-gatchalians-bff-wellex-chairman-peter-salud-passes-away6/), Mr. Salud and William Gatchalian, the “Plastics King” and head of the Gatchalian Family, were close for over 40 years. Mr. Gatchalian recruited Mr. Salud away from his senior manager role at Metrobank in the late 80s. Both WIN and FPI submitted disclosures to announce Mr. Salud’s passing and removal from the respective boards. [FPI indicated](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3e4782b3a4a0baa35d542af6f1e997b9) that its shareholders will select a replacement at the company’s October 27th shareholders’ meeting.

&gt;    - ***MB:*** *Condolences to Mr. Salud’s family and friends. It’s not clear from the reporting on Mr. Salud’s passing whether his death was the result of a longtime illness, or if it was sudden and unexpected. Putting aside the human and emotional toll that death extracts from all of us, of which we’ve become (unfortunately) much more familiar in recent years due to COVID, the passing of an active Chairman is not a straight-forward thing. Procedurally, each company’s board will need to work to identify possible replacements, and their shareholders will need to meet to elect a new Chairman from the slate provided. Operationally, though, the loss of a Chairman can be much more complicated, especially where the leader has been with the company for a great number of years (as is the case with FPI). Even the best-planned transitions go through a brief period of instability when the new leader(s) begin to take the controls. Will FPI and WIN identify and elect replacements that will carry-on in the same direction and style as Mr. Salud, or will they opt to go in a new direction? Will the Family look to place its own blood at the top of the pyramid, or will it look to continue with the professionalization initiative that originally brought Mr. Salud into the group to begin with? With FPI’s shareholders’ meeting on October 27, we won’t have to wait too long to find out.*

&gt;- **[UPDATE]     Medilines [MEDIC 2.45 pre-IPO] shifts IPO date and picks a way better ticker symbol...** The medical supplies business, owned by Manny Villar’s brother, Virgilio, released the [preliminary terms for its upcoming IPO](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b85382e5ec0caa1b5d542af6f1e997b9) and revealed a slight delay in the IPO schedule and a (stylistically) significant change in its ticker symbol. In the draft prospectus, Medilines referred to itself as “MD”, which, though available on the PSE, is a pretty boring ticker symbol. It made sense, I guess, but it didn’t really say much about the company and I have a personal hatred for two-character ticker symbols. The new symbol, “MEDIC”, is a far better choice. In terms of the IPO dates, the new pricing day is on Novembre 16, with the offer period running from November 22 through 28, and IPO now on December 7 (instead of in late November). The total number of shares for sale (825 million) and the primary/secondary split (66/33) remain the same.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** *So while the new ticker symbol is undoubtedly the better choice, this new disclosure did not do anything to change my initial impression of the IPO as something closer to a “cash-out” for Virgilio Villar. He’s selling 250 million of his personal shares in the IPO, and the ₱612 million that he’ll raise through the sale will go to his own pockets, not to grow or improve MEDIC’s business. It’s normal for owners to sometimes take some money off the table and sell their own shares into an IPO, but whether or not that’s a harmless signal or an important signal is very situation-dependent. Maybe Mr. Villar needs to raise money this year to fund some short-term initiative, or maybe he would simply just like to enjoy the fruits of his labors? Hard to say. All I know is that 55% of the proceeds from the sale of the primary shares is going to retire debt, which is, again, fine, but just not that exciting of a growth story. It’s in a critical (and growing) industry. It’s well-connected to an extremely powerful political family with huge national aspirations. It’s just not all that exciting on paper, I guess. Maybe I’ll learn more about the company and get excited about something, and if I do, I will definitely write about it. Until that time, all I have to look forward to now is the headline if the IPO tanks: “MEDIC!!”*

&gt;- **[NEWS]     Century Pacific Food [CNPF 25.50 ▲2.20%] ventures into the pet food segment with new brand, “Goodest”...** The company known for its staple foods announced yesterday that [it will enter into the pet food business](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=efa9e0ca45cbdaeb5d542af6f1e997b9) with a range of products that will be released under its new brand, “Goodest”. CNPF’s Executive Chairman said that the move is intended to capitalize on the domestic and international growth of the pet food industry, especially considering the macro demographic trends that will likely continue to see incomes rise and the middle class grow. CNPF notes that pet ownership is on the rise in the Philippines thanks to the pandemic keeping people close to home, and the changing views of some Filipinos to regard pets as closer to “family’” rather than simply “animals”. Goodest products are available now in supermarket chains and online platforms in the Philippines, starting with its line of affordable cat food.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** *In the US, where the “fur baby” phenomenon is probably the most pronounced in the world, the pet food industry is worth over $70 billion in annual sales and grew 10% in 2020. Many of the products are incredibly high-margin, and are not complicated products to develop, manufacture, ship, or store. Pet food is a very online-friendly business. It also dove-tails nicely with several of CNPF’s other product lines, and the know-how needed to churn out tins of cat food at scale is probably really similar to that which is needed to do the same for its human-facing brands. The Century brand has sentimental value with consumers, and is increasingly associated with healthy living and healthy lifestyle; both of these brand characteristics will probably crossover very effectively into the pet food segment. I will wait to see how this segment actually performs (pricing and retail space are always factors that can cripple even the best product launch), but if I were a CNPF shareholder, I’d be pretty excited to see the company branching out into interesting new segments like this. Very interesting move!*

&gt;- **[NEWS]     Wellex Industries [WIN 0.25 unch] and Forum Pacific [FPI 0.29 unch] mourn passing of Chairman Peter Salud at 66...** Peter Salud was recruited by William Gatchalian a long time ago to assist in the administration of the growing Gatchalian group of companies.

# Roblox Shares Nosedive 30% as User Growth Misses Mark, Sparking Industry-Wide Growth Concerns

Roblox Corporation's fourth-quarter earnings report has sent shockwaves through the gaming industry, causing its stock to plummet by up to 30% in pre-market trading. The company missed key estimates, particularly in daily active users (DAUs), which came in at 85.3 million versus the expected 88.39 million. This shortfall has raised concerns about slowing growth for the popular gaming platform. Despite beating revenue expectations with $988.2 million against an estimated $967.2 million, the company's bookings of $1.36 billion fell short of the $1.37 billion forecast. Roblox's guidance for 2025 also disappointed investors, with bookings projected between $5.20 billion and $5.30 billion, barely surpassing analyst estimates of $5.1 billion. The company's forecast for wider losses in 2025 further compounded investor worries. While Roblox maintains a positive outlook for Q1 2025, with expected bookings of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, the market reaction suggests deep-seated concerns about the platform's ability to maintain its rapid growth trajectory. This earnings miss has broader implications for the gaming sector, potentially signaling a cooldown in the industry's post-pandemic boom.

# Philip Morris Soars on Q4 Earnings Beat, Fueled by Smoke-Free Product Demand and Optimistic 2025 Outlook

Philip Morris International (PM) delivered a strong performance in Q4 2023, beating analyst estimates with adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 and revenue of $9.71 billion. The company's success was largely driven by the surging demand for its smoke-free products, particularly Zyn nicotine pouches and IQOS heated tobacco devices. Zyn shipments saw a significant increase, with sales climbing more than 25% last year. The company's smoke-free transformation strategy appears to be paying off, as smoke-free revenue continues to grow. PM's outlook for 2025 is optimistic, projecting adjusted EPS between $7.04 and $7.17, surpassing analyst expectations. The positive results and future guidance led to a rally in Philip Morris stock, touching record highs. Despite the shift towards smoke-free products, traditional cigarette shipments remained substantial at 152.78 billion units, with 38.39 billion in Europe. The company's CEO expressed satisfaction with the FDA's approval of Zyn, further solidifying PM's position in the evolving tobacco market.

The automaker beat expectations for its fourth-quarter results, with record revenue and strong profits from its Ford Blue and Pro units. However, the company's 2025 outlook has raised concerns among investors and analysts.

# Roblox Shares Nosedive 30% as User Growth Misses Mark, Sparking Industry-Wide Growth Concerns

Roblox Corporation's fourth-quarter earnings report has sent shockwaves through the gaming industry, causing its stock to plummet by up to 30% in pre-market trading. The company missed key estimates, particularly in daily active users (DAUs), which came in at 85.3 million versus the expected 88.39 million. This shortfall has raised concerns about slowing growth for the popular gaming platform. Despite beating revenue expectations with $988.2 million against an estimated $967.2 million, the company's bookings of $1.36 billion fell short of the $1.37 billion forecast. Roblox's guidance for 2025 also disappointed investors, with bookings projected between $5.20 billion and $5.30 billion, barely surpassing analyst estimates of $5.1 billion. The company's forecast for wider losses in 2025 further compounded investor worries. While Roblox maintains a positive outlook for Q1 2025, with expected bookings of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, the market reaction suggests deep-seated concerns about the platform's ability to maintain its rapid growth trajectory. This earnings miss has broader implications for the gaming sector, potentially signaling a cooldown in the industry's post-pandemic boom.

# Philip Morris Soars on Q4 Earnings Beat, Fueled by Smoke-Free Product Demand and Optimistic 2025 Outlook

Philip Morris International (PM) delivered a strong performance in Q4 2023, beating analyst estimates with adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 and revenue of $9.71 billion. The company's success was largely driven by the surging demand for its smoke-free products, particularly Zyn nicotine pouches and IQOS heated tobacco devices. Zyn shipments saw a significant increase, with sales climbing more than 25% last year. The company's smoke-free transformation strategy appears to be paying off, as smoke-free revenue continues to grow. PM's outlook for 2025 is optimistic, projecting adjusted EPS between $7.04 and $7.17, surpassing analyst expectations. The positive results and future guidance led to a rally in Philip Morris stock, touching record highs. Despite the shift towards smoke-free products, traditional cigarette shipments remained substantial at 152.78 billion units, with 38.39 billion in Europe. The company's CEO expressed satisfaction with the FDA's approval of Zyn, further solidifying PM's position in the evolving tobacco market.

#The PSE lost 5 points to 6419 ▼0.1%

Yesterday's story about DoubleDragon's Nasdaq listing of Hotel101 was very inaccurate, and it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding that I had (and still have) about the Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation (SPAC) method that DD used to get Hotel101 to market. 

Please do not use my analysis in that story as the basis for any investing decisions.

I'm working to understand that story better, and when I've wrapped my brain around it, I'll update here. I hope sooner rather than later.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DigiPlus to launch Brazil ops in September...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 45.00 ▼10.0%; 223% avgVol] [[link](https://www.ggrasia.com/digiplus-on-track-for-september-launch-of-brazil-online-gaming-operations)] said it is “on track” to launch its operations in Brazil in September as it seeks to tap a gaming market that is twice the size of the Philippines. In a statement on July 1, 2025, the digital entertainment provider led by **Eusebio Tanco** said it has already deployed a local team with “deep cultural and regulatory knowledge” in Brazil, which has a population of over 200 million and internet penetration of nearly 90%. PLUS said that Brazil is one of Latin America’s fastest-growing gaming markets, with an estimated market size of approximately US$4.6 billion for iGaming. The company said new regulations in Brazil covering licensing, consumer protection and fair taxation helped boost the iGaming sector in the country.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** When PLUS first announced this push into the Brazil gaming market, I was excited because it felt like an intelligent international expansion, and my mind raced with how PLUS could replicate this expansion in other countries and how all that revenue would just look so ridiculous. The move now feels a lot more defensive, with the benefit of hindsight, considering all the noise right now in the Senate to either ban online gaming in the Philippines entirely, or to regulate it to make it more difficult to sign up (minimum ₱10k deposit) and less convenient to play (no e-wallet connections). Like when COVID knocked the vast majority of Jollibee’s PH-based stores offline during the Duterte Lockdown, and the company leaned hard into its international diversification push. That’s now what this Brazil move feels like to me, like PLUS is hedging its bet and moving as quickly as it can to make sure that it has revenue-generating eggs in baskets that are not subject to regulation by our senators.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Del Monte Pacific’s US subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy...** **Del Monte Foods** (DMF), the American subsidiary of **Campos**-led **Del Monte Pacific** [DELM 3.17 ▲0.6%; 284% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=61eb97be7d1bef12ec6e1601ccee8f59)], has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States after striking a restructuring support agreement with a group of its key lenders. DELM said DMF will pursue a “value maximizing “ sale of “all or substantially all” of its assets under a court-backed proceedings initiated in New Jersey on July 1, 2025. But the company said it intends to continue normal operations during the sale process. DMF can access nearly $1 billion in financing to support its day-to-day operations during the restructuring period. DMF’s CEO, **Greg Longstreet**, said that DMF “faced challenges intensified by a dynamic macroeconomic environment.”
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I actually just got a question from a reader that said, paraphrased, “What’s even happening with Del Monte these days? They seem so quiet.” Well, I guess this is what’s happening. They’re trying to figure out how to deal with this bankruptcy. The important thing to note is that it’s not DELM itself that is bankrupt, it’s DELM’s American subsidiary, Del Monte Foods Holdings Limited. DELM’s stock is basically illiquid, and the company operates at a loss with a retained earnings deficit. At this point, DELM’s like a styro pack of fresh-cut pineapple that’s been left out in the sun for a couple of days. Leave it for the ants to pick over.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Manila Water concession extended until 2047...** **Manila Water** [MWC 39.40 ▼0.3%; 42% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=363f57a52a1ff272ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that it has formally received a notice from the **Department of** Economy, Planning and Development of its extended concession agreement on July 1. MWC’s original concession agreement was scheduled to expire in mid-2037, but thanks to this extension, will now run through to the start of 2047. The 10-year extension of the water concession was approved by President **Ferdinand Marcos Jr.** during the inaugural meeting of the **Economy and Development Council** (formerly NEDA Board). The Council also extended the contract of **Maynilad Water** at the same meeting.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** This is just a formality, but I thought I’d mention it since I didn’t talk about the concession agreement extension when it was first announced. This extension is a pretty big deal, but of course, we’re living on the timeline where concession agreements only mean as much as the political will of the co-equal branches of government which exists to protect them. The voodoo magic that transferred its ownership from the **Zobel Family** to the **Razon Family** probably inoculates the Razons against any major issues should President Marcos fail to address the ascendent **Dutertes**, but that’s not something MWC shareholders have to worry about for a long while.

#Read today's full newsletter [here](https://mailchi.mp/merkadobarkada/digiplus-to-launch-brazil-ops-in-september)","DigiPlus to launch Brazil ops in September; Del Monte US subsidiary files for bankruptcy; Manila Water concession extended until 2047 (Thusday, July 3) #Happy Thursday, Barkada --

#The PSE lost 5 points to 6419 ▼0.1%

Yesterday's story about DoubleDragon's Nasdaq listing of Hotel101 was very inaccurate, and it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding that I had (and still have) about the Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation (SPAC) method that DD used to get Hotel101 to market. 

Please do not use my analysis in that story as the basis for any investing decisions.

I'm working to understand that story better, and when I've wrapped my brain around it, I'll update here. I hope sooner rather than later.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[NEWS]  DigiPlus to launch Brazil ops in September...** **DigiPlus** [PLUS 45.00 ▼10.0%; 223% avgVol] [[link](https://www.ggrasia.com/digiplus-on-track-for-september-launch-of-brazil-online-gaming-operations)] said it is “on track” to launch its operations in Brazil in September as it seeks to tap a gaming market that is twice the size of the Philippines. In a statement on July 1, 2025, the digital entertainment provider led by **Eusebio Tanco** said it has already deployed a local team with “deep cultural and regulatory knowledge” in Brazil, which has a population of over 200 million and internet penetration of nearly 90%. PLUS said that Brazil is one of Latin America’s fastest-growing gaming markets, with an estimated market size of approximately US$4.6 billion for iGaming. The company said new regulations in Brazil covering licensing, consumer protection and fair taxation helped boost the iGaming sector in the country.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** When PLUS first announced this push into the Brazil gaming market, I was excited because it felt like an intelligent international expansion, and my mind raced with how PLUS could replicate this expansion in other countries and how all that revenue would just look so ridiculous. The move now feels a lot more defensive, with the benefit of hindsight, considering all the noise right now in the Senate to either ban online gaming in the Philippines entirely, or to regulate it to make it more difficult to sign up (minimum ₱10k deposit) and less convenient to play (no e-wallet connections). Like when COVID knocked the vast majority of Jollibee’s PH-based stores offline during the Duterte Lockdown, and the company leaned hard into its international diversification push. That’s now what this Brazil move feels like to me, like PLUS is hedging its bet and moving as quickly as it can to make sure that it has revenue-generating eggs in baskets that are not subject to regulation by our senators.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Del Monte Pacific’s US subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy...** **Del Monte Foods** (DMF), the American subsidiary of **Campos**-led **Del Monte Pacific** [DELM 3.17 ▲0.6%; 284% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=61eb97be7d1bef12ec6e1601ccee8f59)], has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States after striking a restructuring support agreement with a group of its key lenders. DELM said DMF will pursue a “value maximizing “ sale of “all or substantially all” of its assets under a court-backed proceedings initiated in New Jersey on July 1, 2025. But the company said it intends to continue normal operations during the sale process. DMF can access nearly $1 billion in financing to support its day-to-day operations during the restructuring period. DMF’s CEO, **Greg Longstreet**, said that DMF “faced challenges intensified by a dynamic macroeconomic environment.”
&gt;    - ***MB:*** I actually just got a question from a reader that said, paraphrased, “What’s even happening with Del Monte these days? They seem so quiet.” Well, I guess this is what’s happening. They’re trying to figure out how to deal with this bankruptcy. The important thing to note is that it’s not DELM itself that is bankrupt, it’s DELM’s American subsidiary, Del Monte Foods Holdings Limited. DELM’s stock is basically illiquid, and the company operates at a loss with a retained earnings deficit. At this point, DELM’s like a styro pack of fresh-cut pineapple that’s been left out in the sun for a couple of days. Leave it for the ants to pick over.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Manila Water concession extended until 2047...** **Manila Water** [MWC 39.40 ▼0.3%; 42% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=363f57a52a1ff272ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that it has formally received a notice from the **Department of** Economy, Planning and Development of its extended concession agreement on July 1. MWC’s original concession agreement was scheduled to expire in mid-2037, but thanks to this extension, will now run through to the start of 2047. The 10-year extension of the water concession was approved by President **Ferdinand Marcos Jr.** during the inaugural meeting of the **Economy and Development Council** (formerly NEDA Board). The Council also extended the contract of **Maynilad Water** at the same meeting.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** This is just a formality, but I thought I’d mention it since I didn’t talk about the concession agreement extension when it was first announced. This extension is a pretty big deal, but of course, we’re living on the timeline where concession agreements only mean as much as the political will of the co-equal branches of government which exists to protect them. The voodoo magic that transferred its ownership from the **Zobel Family** to the **Razon Family** probably inoculates the Razons against any major issues should President Marcos fail to address the ascendent **Dutertes**, but that’s not something MWC shareholders have to worry about for a long while.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Philippine Seven announces 100% stock dividend...** **Philippine Seven** [SEVN 115.00 ▲5.0%; 41% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=59c46b590b19b3f7abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] disclosed that its board and shareholders have approved the declaration of a 100% stock dividend that will dristribue one common share of SEVN to shareholders for every one common share of SEVN already owned as of August 2, 2024. The stock dividend will be paid on August 15, 2024. The dividends will be paid out of SEVN’s unissued capital stock. SEVN has declared stock dividends seven other times in its history, with the vast majority being between 5% and 15%. Only one was significantly large, which was the 65% stock dividend announced in 2017 when the company raised its ACS to 1.6 billion shares.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** To the best of my knowledge, SEVN hasn’t given any clues as to why it would do a 1:1 stock dividend, so I’m left only to guess. The declaration wasn’t accompanied by any talk of increasing the company’s authorized capital stock (ACS), so this doesn’t appear to be a CLI Maneuver where a stock dividend is used as a quick non-cash way to “pay” for an ACS increase. Unlike back in 2017, it doesn’t look like this declaration is in service of any kind of ACS increase. And why would it be? SEVN’s management team already had access to over 800 million unissued common shares in its ACS that it could use to sell to an investor through private placement or to the public through a stock rights offering or follow-on offering, but it decided to just “give” those shares to the shareholders instead. Feels like they aren’t in it to raise cash, so I’m left to guess at the typical reason for doing a stock dividend of this type in the absence of paying for an ACS increase, which is to boost liquidity of the shares. By effectively doubling every shareholder’s holdings, SEVN will cut the share price in half (which does basically nothing but gives the appearance of affordability) and increase the number of shares in the public float. Will that make it easier for investors to get in and out of SEVN? I personally don’t think it’s that big of a deal. If I held ₱200k worth of SEVN, it’s probably going to be just as easy to sell my pre-dividend 1700 shares as it would be to sell my post-dividend 3400 shares. It’s probably easier for smaller traders to trade on the margins, but for the bulk of traders dealing in SEVN, this won’t really have an impact.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  Belle Corp planning new Clark casino resort...** **Belle Corp** [BEL 2.17 unch; 137% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2e895c8f75fba7b5abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] confirmed a report that **Premium Leisure Corp** (PLC), BEL’s recently-delisted subsidiary, has applied for a gaming license for a new casino resort in Clark Air Base. BEL said that it is still too early to confirm any other aspects of PLC’s plans, perhaps in reference to the article’s claim that **SM Investments** [SM 902.00 ▼2.3%; 67% avgVol], BEL’s parent company, would invest $300 million (~₱17.4B) in PLC’s Clark casino resort development.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** The SM Group has been making money moves recently, both in terms of raising cash and spending it. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the group go hard to develop a casino resort in Clark considering how hot gaming has been recently with investors and how warmly the non-POGO tax earnings from the gaming sector have been embraced by the government. The technical matter of where the cash for the development will come from is a more interesting question to me, but it looks like BEL and SM just aren’t in a position yet to comment. I have no doubt that the source in the original article is probably in the right ballpark in terms of how much the project will cost, but it sounds like we are a while away from getting a better look at the details on how that amount will be spent and where the money will come from.

&gt;- **[NEWS]  PXP and ENEX both deny undisclosed knowledge of reason for price pumps...** **Philex Petroleum** [PXP 4.15 ▼7.8%; 2136% avgVol] saw its stock price jump up 50% from ₱3.00 on Wednesday to ₱4.50 on Thursday, and **ENEX Energy** [ENEX 5.93 ▼12.7%; 1466% avgVol] saw its stock price jump 47% from ₱4.63 to ₱6.79 on the same day, prompting the **Capital Markets Integrity Corporation** (CMIC) to check in with PXP and ENEX. Both PXP and ENEX denied any knowledge of undisclosed information that might have caused the “unusual price movement” of their respective stocks. It seems the actual cause of the panic buying was a [story by VERA Files](https://verafiles.org/articles/malacanang-lifts-moratorium-on-recto-bank-oil-and-gas-exploration) that Malacañang had “unofficially lifted” the moratorium on oil and natural gas exploration in the Recto Bank area.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** It’s important to remember that when the CMIC reaches out to get a sworn statement from a company that pumps with no disclosures, they’re basically trying to give the company a chance to make anything official that might have leaked to try and level the information playing field as quickly as possible for other investors. But the question to PXP and ENEX wasn’t just a gossipy “so, do you know anything that might have caused this?” kind of thing: they’re asking if PXP or ENEX has any previously-indisclosed material information that needs to be disclosed. From that perspective, the “we know nothing about nothing” responses from PXP and ENEX should be read as “we don’t have any first-hand knowledge of material facts that could have caused the buying interest”. They’re not denying the rumor, just denying knowledge of what the rumor claims to say. Tread carefully, though. The pullbacks in absence of confirmation could be severe.

2025-03-05,2025-03-05 22:17:54,Reddit,search_result,economicCollapse,The US economy is already dead... it just doesn't know it yet.,"Someone recommended this sub for a re-posting of my little prediction of doom. Enjoy, so far as you are able:

**To be specific: The US will go into acute stagflation inside of 4 months, which will then transition to a depression more severe than the 2008 crisis before the end of the year. And it's already unavoidable.**

We are seeing the building blocks of a disaster the likes of which we haven't seen in generations, and it's a question of when, not if it goes off the rails. 

**First, there's massive inflationary pressure right now:**

* Prices of imported goods have started to rise sharply because companies have to be prepared to weather tariff price spikes, if they actually happen or not
* International trade is no longer reliable, because the administration flip-flops on trade agreements daily, making goods less available
* Neighboring sources of vital construction materials are being antagonised while the country needs to rebuild after massive wildfires
* Agricultural output will be extremely unreliable due to... [*gestures broadly at everything*] but mostly deporting farm workers, bird flu and draining the california agricultural reservoirs

**Second, those same things can also trigger a recession and there's more:**

* The federal government is going to stop paying for things, basically at random. 20% of GDP is now unreliable.
* Crypto-bro tech-moguls are sniping at each other, presidents are hawking meme-coins, law enforcement is in the hands of partisan imbeciles and the SEC is about to be gutted. Fraud will run rampant. Noone knows if that will juice or tank the stock market, but it scares people
* Big Tech which contribues ~10% of US GDP directly has alligned itself with the government. Around the world but mostly in Europe boycots are forming. China releasing an AI competitor saw a 3% drop in the Nasdaq, with over half a trillion dollars wiped off of the valuation of one top stock. They are *fragile*, and particularly reliant on international suppliers like TSMC and ASML.
* It is entirely possible that the US will default on its debt, either by whim of its new rulers, or through gross incompetence of the hacker known as ~~4chan~~ BigBalls who has been put in charge of the treasury payment system. Something nearly impossible in normal circumstances could be ordered by the president, and be carried out before anyone realises what has happened. And then the dollar is over.

**Unemployment will be off the charts:**

* Tens of thousands of government workers are being (illegally) fired, and contractors dumped, aiming at up to a million unemployed - but that's just the start.
* Right now 30,000 are confirmed. But OPM has mandated firing 200,000 probationary employees hired just in the last year to be let go by september, and that's not even counting contractors. Federal agencies rely heavily on contract employees, so we can expect 2-3 contractors to lose their income per federal employee lost.
* That's the direct workers, but there's much more: when something like HUD is dismantled by cutting 84% of the ~8000 workers, that means it simply *cannot operate*. HUD administers programs like LIHTC and JPIP which support over 90.000 jobs annually, primarily small businesses.
* With USAID shut down by cutting 14.000 employees the spending *stops*; billions of dollars of that spending went to farms in the midwest that have lost their contracts, their livelyhoods. 80% of that 60 billion dollar USAID budget went to US firms - it was an indirect subsidy that secured hundreds of thousands of jobs.
* Then there's the hiring freezes all over - not just in the government but the affected programs like university-administered medical research.
* There's maybe two dozen people authorized to actually administer and pay out the 30 billion dollars per year that the IRA distributes, fire them and all that goes away. It's authorised, the money is there, it just doesn't get spent. That's a lot of jobs.
* This isn't even taking into account the people losing their jobs to the tariffs and further trade war insanity.

The ripple effects here are going to greatly disproportional to the first-order numbers.

Inflation is manageable. A recession is manageable. High unemployment is manageable. A failed harvest is manageable. A trade deal breaking up is manageable. A constitutional crisis is manageable. A supply chain disruption is manageable. A war is manageable. A reduction in government spending is manageable. A breakup of an alliance is manageable.

*But not all at once.*

If these trends all manage to hit, which they almost certainly will, we will be seeing a collapse of employment and industry combined with rising prices: classic 80's style stagflation. 

The inflation will be transitory - the prices will probably only go up initially as the tariffs are threatened, then imposed and trade starts to fail. After a short while of stockpiles depleting prices might go up a little more, but it would basically reach a new normal at a higher price point. Agriculture will recover, etc. Still, it's a good year or two of suck. In the mean time that inflation will paralyse the Fed: They'll want to lower rates to counter the recession, but bond markets would rebel because of the inflation. QE would be a possible response, but would also be seen as irresponsible with 'room to cut' being available and inflation already at a high point.

With the regime being too [redacted] to respond to the self-inflicted damage [things will turn nasty](https://youtu.be/68Dlb4B3m24?si=SFC7XrNTrhnuu84y&amp;t=138). With most adults in the room purged outright or sidelined, the recession will quickly transition to a [debt-deflation spiral](https://www.socialscience.international/hyman-minsky-financial-instability-hypothesis), and somewhere along the way the massive bubble in asset prices is going to pop and we'll see the 3rd [Minsky moment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minskymoment.asp) of the past century. That's when the **Greatest Depression** starts, folks.

Some believe that the regime's economic 'thinkers' (Bessent, Lutnick, Miran, Navarro) have explicitly planned to crush the economy as soon as possible so they can say it was ""biden’s economy"" that crashed; this would let them both profit off the collapse, and allow the president to swoop in and rescue the country. But be it malice or gross incompetence... such a rescue is not possible.

**Roadblocks to recovery:**

* The investments needed to re-shore and re-build the manufacturing capacity to compensate for supply that is being cut off internationally will not happen because expected returns are impossible to predict, and spending is already cratering
* Even if new factories are built - which would take years - to be profitable modern manufacturing is hyper-productive; it creates lots of product but almost no jobs. A few engineers and maintenance people can do the work of hundreds of manual labourers - there is no way to absorb the massive unemployment that's coming, and few able to afford the products.
* The last time the US was in stagflation was in the 1970s, it was ended with Volcker's Hammer - Paul Volcker, the head of the Fed, raised interest rates to 20%. This caused a severe recession which wrecked the economy and allowed a reset. The current leadership would not allow that. The president is pushing hard for interest rate cuts, and a head-on collision between the Federal Reserve and the office of the President will be intensely destructive to market confidence.
* Counteracting the collapsing stock market will require re-capitalisation by the Fed of various institutions that the regime *does not like*, and which its main economists would actively seek to prevent - by the time a 'healthy correction' had turned into a complete slaughter, the Fed will be powerless
* Recovery from any of these would be a difficult, long-term problem, maybe a decade or more. But the DOGE wrecking-ball is preventing anyone from even trying to recover or even maintain anything. They're gutting the federal government, firing everyone with the kind of institutional knowledge needed to staunch the bleeding or turn around a decline. At best there's going to be a survival situation, where they manage to salvage some of the nation's resources under their own control.

The modern world is filled with complexity that requires the admnistrative state, and despite claims to the contary it is not being made efficient... it is being systematically destroyed. 

The theory (such as it is) is that all government spending is inefficient, and 'crowds out' private enterprise. So if you get rid of the government, private enterprise will flourish. What actually happens is that aggregate demand plumets, and GDP gets wrecked. That's how when Greece cut 30% of government spening, it also lost 30% of its GDP. It hasn't recovered since 2010 and the US is now doing that to itself.

If I'm right, we'll see the first major shock come in on March 7th, when the febuary unemployment numbers come in. That won't be the worst of it, because there's a lot of inertia in 'the economy'. It's like a big oil tanker, it doens't just change course on a dime. But someone decided to put a great big iceberg right in its path, and I'm betting that will bring it to a stop *real fast*.

**Wildcards in the mix:**

* An upcoming bird flu epidemic which has already jumped to cattle and cats with high mortality rate; but measles might get there first
* The FBI and CIA are being actively purged, leaving the country open to [terrorist attacks](https://theonion.com/fbi-uncovers-al-qaeda-plot-to-just-sit-back-and-enjoy-c-1819576375/)
* Previously secure Federal IT has been breached creating breathtaking vulnerabilities in key system
* There is a cult of techno-feudalists who want the USA to collapse into Sovereign Crypto-bro Kingdoms, and both Musk and Thiel are part of it
* It is possible the regime is pushing for civil resistance to reach the level where they can declare martial law, which could lead to secession of Blue states and/or outright civil war

None of these are even neccesary for collapse, but they might speed up what I believe is already inevitable.


**So good news everyone: there will be no Trump 3rd term, and the US won't be joining a new axis of evil... it will barely survive the coming year. This will take the world economy with it. Brace yourselves**

Someone recommended this sub for a re-posting of my little prediction of doom. Enjoy, so far as you are able:

**To be specific: The US will go into acute stagflation inside of 4 months, which will then transition to a depression more severe than the 2008 crisis before the end of the year. And it's already unavoidable.**

We are seeing the building blocks of a disaster the likes of which we haven't seen in generations, and it's a question of when, not if it goes off the rails. 

**First, there's massive inflationary pressure right now:**

* Prices of imported goods have started to rise sharply because companies have to be prepared to weather tariff price spikes, if they actually happen or not
* International trade is no longer reliable, because the administration flip-flops on trade agreements daily, making goods less available
* Neighboring sources of vital construction materials are being antagonised while the country needs to rebuild after massive wildfires
* Agricultural output will be extremely unreliable due to... [*gestures broadly at everything*] but mostly deporting farm workers, bird flu and draining the california agricultural reservoirs

**Second, those same things can also trigger a recession and there's more:**

* The federal government is going to stop paying for things, basically at random. 20% of GDP is now unreliable.
* Crypto-bro tech-moguls are sniping at each other, presidents are hawking meme-coins, law enforcement is in the hands of partisan imbeciles and the SEC is about to be gutted. Fraud will run rampant. Noone knows if that will juice or tank the stock market, but it scares people
* Big Tech which contribues ~10% of US GDP directly has alligned itself with the government. Around the world but mostly in Europe boycots are forming. China releasing an AI competitor saw a 3% drop in the Nasdaq, with over half a trillion dollars wiped off of the valuation of one top stock. They are *fragile*, and particularly reliant on international suppliers like TSMC and ASML.
* It is entirely possible that the US will default on its debt, either by whim of its new rulers, or through gross incompetence of the hacker known as ~~4chan~~ BigBalls who has been put in charge of the treasury payment system. Something nearly impossible in normal circumstances could be ordered by the president, and be carried out before anyone realises what has happened. And then the dollar is over.

**Unemployment will be off the charts:**

* Tens of thousands of government workers are being (illegally) fired, and contractors dumped, aiming at up to a million unemployed - but that's just the start.
* Right now 30,000 are confirmed. But OPM has mandated firing 200,000 probationary employees hired just in the last year to be let go by september, and that's not even counting contractors. Federal agencies rely heavily on contract employees, so we can expect 2-3 contractors to lose their income per federal employee lost.
* That's the direct workers, but there's much more: when something like HUD is dismantled by cutting 84% of the ~8000 workers, that means it simply *cannot operate*. HUD administers programs like LIHTC and JPIP which support over 90.000 jobs annually, primarily small businesses.

* Then there's the hiring freezes all over - not just in the government but the affected programs like university-administered medical research.
* There's maybe two dozen people authorized to actually administer and pay out the 30 billion dollars per year that the IRA distributes, fire them and all that goes away. It's authorised, the money is there, it just doesn't get spent. That's a lot of jobs.

2025-04-02,2025-04-02 12:32:37,Reddit,search_result,stocks,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

##Freedom House presents evidence of Yugoslavia-style ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh by the Azerbaijani regime 

Freedom House presented evidence from its fact-finding mission about Nagorno-Karabakh, which concluded that the forced displacement of ethnic Armenians was intentionally coordinated and committed by the Azerbaijani government.

The Freedom House called the attention of the OSCE ODIHR and participating States to the treatment of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, whereby they were intentionally subjected to years of regular attacks, intimidation, deprivation of basic rights, and ultimately forced displacement by the Azerbaijani state in September 2023. 

&gt;these conclusions are the result of an intensive international fact-finding effort

...

&gt;This factfinding, which included hundreds of witness interviews and analysis of open-source data, concludes that the Azerbaijani state acted upon a comprehensive, methodically implemented strategy to empty Nagorno-Karabakh of its ethnic Armenian population and historical and cultural presence

...

&gt;the documented actions of the Azerbaijani state meet the criteria for ethnic cleansing as understood in the context of the UN Commission of Experts’ analysis on IHL violations in the former Yugoslavia

...

&gt;We have documented extrajudicial executions, torture, arbitrary arrests and detention, restrictions on the access to food and life-saving medication, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property

...

&gt;The fact-finding mission has determined that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that these practices constitute crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, including Article 7 (crimes against humanity), and Article 8 (war crimes), and align with the definition of deportation or forcible transfer of population

##... Freedom House calls on OSCE states to 

• Invoke the Moscow Mechanism to investigate violations committed against ethnic Armenians.

• Advocate within the UN Human Rights Council for the establishment of a country mechanism and a Special Procedure on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan.

• Support international efforts to prosecute crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against the ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... Freedom House calls on the Government of Azerbaijan to 

• Provide secure access to Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh to visit their homes and collect their belongings, as well as to uphold the right to return for Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh under international observations.

• Provide access to international monitoring initiatives to investigate the state of cultural monuments in Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent territories.

• Abstain from violence-inducing rhetoric against Armenians.

##pro-Russian opposition forces led by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan demand war crime charges against Prime Minister Pashinyan for ""aiding the genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh"" 

Bagrat, ARF, and hundreds of followers gathered in front of the prosecutor's office in Yerevan on Wednesday and demanded criminal charges to be filed against Pashinyan for ""abetting"" the genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... divisions continue to grow within Bagrat's camp

Regular readers of Transcaucasian Telegraph may recall that Bagrat recently lost the support of several factions, was publicly criticized by some opposition media outlets for his handling of anti-Pashinyan protests, while his friend and mentor Archbishop Ajapahyan publicly criticized him for cozying up to ex-leaders Robert Kocharyan and Serj Sargsyan who are ""toxic"" and ""alienate"" possible supporters. 

During the Wednesday rally in front of the prosecutor's office, Bagrat was confronted with more uncomfortable questions:

**REPORTER:** Srbazan, you feel bad when the pro-government figures disrespect the clergymen by not using their church titles. But what is the difference between the government and opposition figures doing the same? We saw that the people standing next to you, Garnik Isagulyan, who describes himself as a supporter of Kocharyan, criticized Archbishop Ajapahyan and [basically called Ajapahyan an ungrateful man because Kocharyan is not the one attacking the church, so why would Ajapahyan trashtalk Kocharyan and urge him to leave politics].

**BAGRAT:** [tells people to watch his earlier videos, a common response he uses to avoid tough questions] I again urge people to exercise decency.   

**REPORTER:** Have Kocharyan and Serj obstructed [harmed] your movement in any shape or form?

**BAGRAT:** No one has and no one can obstruct our movement.
 
**REPORTER:** If the two ex-leaders announce their exit from politics, will that help you? 

**BAGRAT:** Please, contact their offices and ask them. You are taking this in the wrong direction. From day one, our only target is Pashinyan, the threat to Armenia. We must remove Pashinyan to liberate Armenia's statehood. // &gt;!*[Bagrat wants ""Real Armenia"" to win? 🤔 surprising]*!&lt;

##Pashinyan office lauds the Tuesday announcement to entirely remove Russian agents from the checkpoint in the Armenia-Iran border and partly take over the AM-TR and AM-IR border guarding duties 

**PASHINYAN STAFF:** This was an important and significant step in the establishment of statehood. The control of Armenia's state borders is gradually being transferred to Armenian state services. //

When asked whether the Government plans to entirely remove Russian soldiers from Turkey and Iran borders, DefCom chief Andranik said Armenia needs time to adapt to the new tasks, and that once the border contract with Russia expires, Armenia must be ready to take full control of border protection.

##Russia plans to ""sanction"" several Armenian business owners for financially supporting the pro-West Pashinyan administration: source 

Serj-era MP Samvel Alexanyan (Lfik Samo), who after the 2018 revolution no longer found it necessary to be an MP to preserve his businesses, decided to leave politics. He reportedly began to support the Pashinyan administration financially, according to complaints by Armenia's pro-Russian opposition. 

As you know from the [October 8 telegraph,](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1fzd7bu/transcaucasian_telegraph_brings_you_events_of/) Russian airport authorities blocked Lfik from entering Russia. He was forced to fly back. 

According to an undisclosed source of a pro-Russian opposition media outlet in Armenia, there may be two reasons why Lfik was blocked:

(1) Lfik allegedly has or had business ties with a Sochi-based businessman named Ruben Tatulyan, aka Robson. The latter is wanted by Russian authorities for allegedly embezzling billions of rubles during construction projects. 

(2) Russia has drafted a list of Armenian business owners who help the Pashinyan administration. Their entry to Russia will be blocked.

• Georgian government officials are fueling a climate of hatred

• EP demands the freezing of all EU funding provided to the Georgian government until the undemocratic laws are repealed

• recommends sanctioning all those responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia, including Bidzina Ivanishvili

• upcoming parliamentary elections will be decisive in determining Georgia’s future democratic development and geopolitical choice

##... EU foreign minister Joseph Borrell about Georgia:

• governing authorities have proposed laws (anti-civil society, anti-media, anti-minority, anti-EU rhetoric) that have moved the country away from the EU 

• Georgia's European Union accession process has been halted

• political contacts have been downgraded

• European Union support through the European Peace Facility, worth €30 million, is on hold,

##Russia's economy faces an 'unsolvable trilemma' but can survive up to 8 years: Carnegie fellow Alexandra Prokopenko

• mounting economic issues that could prove unsolvable

• the boosted defense spending for 2025 *(40% of all federal spending is on defense)* will exacerbate economic imbalances at home 

• West doesn't like to hear it, but it will take up to 8 years before Russia has to confront its own overspending

• West must focus on a long-term strategy to further constrain Putin's war machine. Make it more expensive for Putin to do business. It's already hurting defense modernization efforts. 

• Putin faces an unsolvable trilemma of simultaneously maintaining a balanced financial system, meeting social obligations, and sustaining defense spending

• Russia will spend less on healthcare, education, and sciences

##Russia fast-tracks economic fixes as war costs bite: Newsweek 

• The Central Bank raised the interest rate by 1% to 19% in September but the inflation remains stubbornly high. 

• The next CB meeting is on October 25 and people expect it to rise to 20%. That would match the ""emergency rate"" that they set in April 2022, shortly after the launch of the war. 

• Recent Western efforts to tighten secondary sanctions and sanctions on the Moscow Stock Exchange are making it increasingly difficult for Russia to trade internationally 
 
• When the U.S. sanctioned the Moscow Exchange in June, Russia switched to over-the-counter trading data to set exchange rates. Since then, the ruble has lost 17% vs yuan, 15% vs dollar, 10% vs euro.

• ""Hiking rates, tapping foreign exchange reserves and allowing the ruble to weaken all suggest pressures on Russia's balance of payments""

• The Russian economy is overheating because of the war, and this is creating imbalances and foreign exchange shortages
 
• Huge troop losses and people fleeing the draft have caused a labor shortage fueling wages. Inflation in August was 9%

• subsidized credits to support military production are effectively transfers of taxpayers' wealth to the owners of military industrial enterprises

• the market interest rate is playing a decreasing role and, ""together with the tight labor market, is limiting the Central Bank's ability to fight price increases driven by factors such as trade sanctions or increases in world oil prices,"" 

• the price of imported goods is on the rise because of new payment problems with China and Turkey, because the two fear secondary sanctions by the U.S.

Some good news for the Kremlin:

• Gold reserves are on the decline but the price of gold has risen by 27% so these profits could strengthen the ruble's position next year

##Russia's struggling auto industry is begging for help 

Russians lost easy access to Western cars after the war. Now the Russian domestic auto industry is complaining about a mass ""dumping"" of vehicles from China. They want the Kremlin to grant legal protections and subsidies. 

The Russian government has already enacted a set of tariffs that will go into effect this year and raise the price of foreign vehicles by 10%-80%.

Independent Russian auto industry expert Sergey Aslanyan says even after it recently became more difficult for Russian consumers to buy Chinese cars, they are still preferring them over Russian-made cars.  

**ASLANYAN:** In reality, there is no Chinese government policy of expansionism to capture the Russian auto market. This isn't China or the Chinese auto industry doing it. This is private Russian resellers invading Russia with Chinese cars by importing them. In the old days, they would visit China to import sneakers; now it's cars. So the Russian audio industry leaders are, in fact, fighting against Russians who do not wish to wear a frumpy piece of clothing made in a factory named after Comrade Stalin.

##global finance bosses plan to skip the COP29 Climate Summit in Azerbaijan: Financial Times 

&gt;The bosses of Bank of America, BlackRock, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank are among prominent financiers who are expected to skip the UN COP29

##... why?

&gt;“difficult logistics” and fewer client networking opportunities than at COP28 in Dubai last year.

&gt;“You only go to the party if everyone is going.”

&gt;Some also indicated they intended to be at COP30 in Brazil next year instead, arguing this year was a “technical COP” less suited to business.

&gt;Others said they were focused on different climate-related events, such as the COP16 UN Biodiversity Conference in Colombia

&gt;The petrostate, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, has drawn criticism for not placing a focus on the transition away from fossil fuels that was pledged in Dubai, as well as for its human rights record

##Jerusalem’s Armenian Patriarchate wins a lawsuit to recover its vast properties in Turkey

Jerusalem’s Armenian Patriarchate has won the lawsuit filed in 2021 to recover its vast properties in Turkey confiscated decades ago.

&gt;Turkey’s General Directorate of Foundations (GDF) confiscated the Jerusalem Patriarchate’s properties in 1973, describing the Mar Yakoup Armenian Church Foundation, established during the Ottoman Empire, as no longer functional.

##former Nagorno-Karabakh defense leader Samvel Babayan about other opportunities for Armenia to become a transit hub for international cargo 

**BABAYAN:** Do you know how the cargo reaches Baghdad, Mosul, and this region today? (1) It goes through Azerbaijan to the AZ-IR border, where it's loaded into Iranian trucks and transported to Iraq. This route is 810 km. (2) From Turkey's Black Sea port to Iraq. This route is 910 km.  

If this was transported through Armenia's Gyumri railway and Yeraskh, it would be only 700 km. We would save them 4 hours and make it cheaper. Also, the Iraqi trucks could deal directly with us instead of monopolists. This would lead to the passage of goods worth $15B-$20B through Armenia. This would also benefit Georgia and encourage them to open the Abkhazia railway. //

##the situation in Lebanon, by Lebanese-Armenian Vardan Khachaturean 

**QUESTION:** What's the situation in Beirut? Are the Armenian districts being bombed? 

**VARDAN:** Every community has its location in Beirut. Central and Western Beirut are populated by mixed communities. South houses the Shia. East houses the Christians and Armenians. East is not being bombed but we can hear the daily explosions very clearly. They mainly bomb the South, where the Shia live. Armenians are 7 km away from the so-called safety zone. 

**QUESTION:** Are there losses among Armenians?

**VARDAN:** No deaths, but there are many refugees near the Armenian districts. It's a chaotic situation. There are no more apartments for rent, there is inflation, etc. 

**QUESTION:** Any plans to leave?

**VARDAN:** The Armenian community has no plans to migrate. There is also no official program by the Armenian government, according to Lebanese-Armenian officials. Of course there is always a desire to move to Armenia, but people are financially constrained and local banks have confiscated their deposits. *[ahh, the infamous bank robberies]*

The utility regulator has approved new rules on compensation for frequent power cuts and water supply interruptions.

In case of repeated failure to restore the service within X hours, the utility companies will pay larger penalties: 50% of the average monthly cost up to ֏10,000 (it's currently ֏2,000). Various violations will cost various amounts. Details in the source.

Power grid operator ՀԷՑ was (obviously) against the change but said they will remain vigilant and respond to outages promptly. This is our business, we lose money every time there is a power outage, said the company in response to accusations that the company ""doesn't care"" about outages.   

The fire damage at a Yerevan power station, which led to massive outages in central Yerevan this summer, has been mostly remedied. 

ՀԷՑ claims that 33% of all power outages are caused by external factors such as construction workers accidentally cutting power lines.

**PASHINYAN STAFF:** This was an important and significant step in the establishment of statehood. The control of Armenia's state borders is gradually being transferred to Armenian state services. //

When asked whether the Government plans to entirely remove Russian soldiers from Turkey and Iran borders, DefCom chief Andranik said Armenia needs time to adapt to the new tasks, and that once the border contract with Russia expires, Armenia must be ready to take full control of border protection.

##Russia plans to ""sanction"" several Armenian business owners for financially supporting the pro-West Pashinyan administration: source 

Serj-era MP Samvel Alexanyan (Lfik Samo), who after the 2018 revolution no longer found it necessary to be an MP to preserve his businesses, decided to leave politics. He reportedly began to support the Pashinyan administration financially, according to complaints by Armenia's pro-Russian opposition. 

As you know from the [October 8 telegraph,](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1fzd7bu/transcaucasian_telegraph_brings_you_events_of/) Russian airport authorities blocked Lfik from entering Russia. He was forced to fly back. 

According to an undisclosed source of a pro-Russian opposition media outlet in Armenia, there may be two reasons why Lfik was blocked:

(1) Lfik allegedly has or had business ties with a Sochi-based businessman named Ruben Tatulyan, aka Robson. The latter is wanted by Russian authorities for allegedly embezzling billions of rubles during construction projects. 

(2) Russia has drafted a list of Armenian business owners who help the Pashinyan administration. Their entry to Russia will be blocked.

##Russia's economy faces an 'unsolvable trilemma' but can survive up to 8 years: Carnegie fellow Alexandra Prokopenko

• mounting economic issues that could prove unsolvable

• the boosted defense spending for 2025 *(40% of all federal spending is on defense)* will exacerbate economic imbalances at home 

• West doesn't like to hear it, but it will take up to 8 years before Russia has to confront its own overspending

• West must focus on a long-term strategy to further constrain Putin's war machine. Make it more expensive for Putin to do business. It's already hurting defense modernization efforts. 

• Putin faces an unsolvable trilemma of simultaneously maintaining a balanced financial system, meeting social obligations, and sustaining defense spending

• Russia will spend less on healthcare, education, and sciences

##Russia fast-tracks economic fixes as war costs bite: Newsweek 

• The Central Bank raised the interest rate by 1% to 19% in September but the inflation remains stubbornly high. 

• The next CB meeting is on October 25 and people expect it to rise to 20%. That would match the ""emergency rate"" that they set in April 2022, shortly after the launch of the war. 

• Recent Western efforts to tighten secondary sanctions and sanctions on the Moscow Stock Exchange are making it increasingly difficult for Russia to trade internationally 
 
• When the U.S. sanctioned the Moscow Exchange in June, Russia switched to over-the-counter trading data to set exchange rates. Since then, the ruble has lost 17% vs yuan, 15% vs dollar, 10% vs euro.

• ""Hiking rates, tapping foreign exchange reserves and allowing the ruble to weaken all suggest pressures on Russia's balance of payments""

• The Russian economy is overheating because of the war, and this is creating imbalances and foreign exchange shortages
 
• Huge troop losses and people fleeing the draft have caused a labor shortage fueling wages. Inflation in August was 9%

• subsidized credits to support military production are effectively transfers of taxpayers' wealth to the owners of military industrial enterprises

• the market interest rate is playing a decreasing role and, ""together with the tight labor market, is limiting the Central Bank's ability to fight price increases driven by factors such as trade sanctions or increases in world oil prices,"" 

• the price of imported goods is on the rise because of new payment problems with China and Turkey, because the two fear secondary sanctions by the U.S.

Some good news for the Kremlin:

• Gold reserves are on the decline but the price of gold has risen by 27% so these profits could strengthen the ruble's position next year

##Russia's struggling auto industry is begging for help 

Russians lost easy access to Western cars after the war. Now the Russian domestic auto industry is complaining about a mass ""dumping"" of vehicles from China. They want the Kremlin to grant legal protections and subsidies. 

The Russian government has already enacted a set of tariffs that will go into effect this year and raise the price of foreign vehicles by 10%-80%.

Independent Russian auto industry expert Sergey Aslanyan says even after it recently became more difficult for Russian consumers to buy Chinese cars, they are still preferring them over Russian-made cars.  

**ASLANYAN:** In reality, there is no Chinese government policy of expansionism to capture the Russian auto market. This isn't China or the Chinese auto industry doing it. This is private Russian resellers invading Russia with Chinese cars by importing them. In the old days, they would visit China to import sneakers; now it's cars. So the Russian audio industry leaders are, in fact, fighting against Russians who do not wish to wear a frumpy piece of clothing made in a factory named after Comrade Stalin.

##global finance bosses plan to skip the COP29 Climate Summit in Azerbaijan: Financial Times 

&gt;The bosses of Bank of America, BlackRock, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank are among prominent financiers who are expected to skip the UN COP29

##... why?

&gt;“difficult logistics” and fewer client networking opportunities than at COP28 in Dubai last year.

&gt;“You only go to the party if everyone is going.”

&gt;Some also indicated they intended to be at COP30 in Brazil next year instead, arguing this year was a “technical COP” less suited to business.

&gt;Others said they were focused on different climate-related events, such as the COP16 UN Biodiversity Conference in Colombia

&gt;The petrostate, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, has drawn criticism for not placing a focus on the transition away from fossil fuels that was pledged in Dubai, as well as for its human rights record

##Jerusalem’s Armenian Patriarchate wins a lawsuit to recover its vast properties in Turkey

Jerusalem’s Armenian Patriarchate has won the lawsuit filed in 2021 to recover its vast properties in Turkey confiscated decades ago.

##former Nagorno-Karabakh defense leader Samvel Babayan about other opportunities for Armenia to become a transit hub for international cargo 

**BABAYAN:** Do you know how the cargo reaches Baghdad, Mosul, and this region today? (1) It goes through Azerbaijan to the AZ-IR border, where it's loaded into Iranian trucks and transported to Iraq. This route is 810 km. (2) From Turkey's Black Sea port to Iraq. This route is 910 km.  

If this was transported through Armenia's Gyumri railway and Yeraskh, it would be only 700 km. We would save them 4 hours and make it cheaper. Also, the Iraqi trucks could deal directly with us instead of monopolists. This would lead to the passage of goods worth $15B-$20B through Armenia. This would also benefit Georgia and encourage them to open the Abkhazia railway. //

##the situation in Lebanon, by Lebanese-Armenian Vardan Khachaturean 

**QUESTION:** What's the situation in Beirut? Are the Armenian districts being bombed? 

**VARDAN:** Every community has its location in Beirut. Central and Western Beirut are populated by mixed communities. South houses the Shia. East houses the Christians and Armenians. East is not being bombed but we can hear the daily explosions very clearly. They mainly bomb the South, where the Shia live. Armenians are 7 km away from the so-called safety zone. 

**QUESTION:** Are there losses among Armenians?

**VARDAN:** No deaths, but there are many refugees near the Armenian districts. It's a chaotic situation. There are no more apartments for rent, there is inflation, etc. 

**QUESTION:** Any plans to leave?

**VARDAN:** The Armenian community has no plans to migrate. There is also no official program by the Armenian government, according to Lebanese-Armenian officials. Of course there is always a desire to move to Armenia, but people are financially constrained and local banks have confiscated their deposits. *[ahh, the infamous bank robberies]*

##government toughens the sanctions for disruption of power and water supply 

The utility regulator has approved new rules on compensation for frequent power cuts and water supply interruptions.

In case of repeated failure to restore the service within X hours, the utility companies will pay larger penalties: 50% of the average monthly cost up to ֏10,000 (it's currently ֏2,000). Various violations will cost various amounts. Details in the source.

Power grid operator ՀԷՑ was (obviously) against the change but said they will remain vigilant and respond to outages promptly. This is our business, we lose money every time there is a power outage, said the company in response to accusations that the company ""doesn't care"" about outages.   

The fire damage at a Yerevan power station, which led to massive outages in central Yerevan this summer, has been mostly remedied. 

ՀԷՑ claims that 33% of all power outages are caused by external factors such as construction workers accidentally cutting power lines.

“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&amp;sid=sitemap&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&amp;aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&amp;P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

**Epilogue**  
Uneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood.

The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&amp;P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

**Epilogue**  
Uneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood.

The effectiveness of boycotts is debatable and many people will often comment stating it's pointless and throw out their best gotchas but at the end of the day if supporting a government like the CCP financially doesn't sit right with you and you get frustrated by seeing your government constrained in it's actions by economic reasons then you can look at where you can reduce your consumerism of products that benefit the CCP, also realise corporate and consumer greed in New Zealand and other countries has caused this dangerous over reliance we now face.

It's certainly not pointless and stopping Chinese dependency isn't an overnight process but reducing your own purchase of Chinese products is a good place to start. 

Outside of electronics and pharmaceuticals the difficulty of purchasing non Chinese made products in New Zealand is often overstated and quite easily achievable in most cases. 

The extent to which you do this is up to you. You may look at a changing the way you live significantly and reduce your consumerism overall, buying more second-hand, getting into DIY and 3D printing or may just look at alternative sources for products where and when it's viable to you.

Buying used Chinese products is still ensuring Chinese products retain resale value but still better than buying new. You may not want to support some of the alternative source countries either whether it's the US, India, Israel or Vietnam for example where China owns a lot of factories so they can label the origin as Vietnam and also dodge tariffs by rerouting goods using transshipment methods. It's up to you to do research and find a product you're comfortable buying from as all major manufacturing countries have issues regarding human rights and ethics.

It's not only about avoiding Chinese products and as a member of the public you can influence NZ businesses to move production out of China or source products from elsewhere. Let stores know you don't want to purchase Chinese made products and offer alternatives you're interested in, they will take into consideration customer demand.

Email politicians and express your concerns and need for divestment from China, these people often need motivation to actually do something and create effective policies that will reduce dependency.

-----------------------------

**Given the current state of the world now it's possibly the best time to start reducing buying Chinese products if you haven't already with trade issues between China, US, Australia, India, Japan and Korea ongoing. Rising manufacturing costs, regulations and an increasingly unstable geopolitical situation are forcing more manufacturers to move production elsewhere and many have began in the last few years as they wean themselves off the Chinese manufacturing that has shaped the global economy for the past 30 years.
Hyundai Steel and several other South Korean major businesses are planning to shut Chinese factories and move to elsewhere such as India along with waves of other companies.**

Last year Australian companies stopped importing cotton sourced from the Chinese province of Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuse in forced labor camps came to light and a recent survey showed
88% of Australians want to boycott Chinese products. 

India and Tibet have called for a joint campaign to boycott Chinese goods in response to border intrusion incidents perpetrated by China. Calls to boycott Chinese products have been common for some time in the Philippines, Tibetan and Vietnam and many people in the UK are urging the government to also ban the import of all cotton made by forced labour in Xinjiang. Even many mainland Chinese are calling for boycotts of Chinese made products.


Boycotts are nothing new and often unsuccessful due to being a short lived trend and dissipated within months as economics quickly dissolve any binds perpetuated by ethics and isolationism. China boycotted all Japanese products in the 1930's and still regularly boycott countries products, the US tried to boycott French goods in 2003 and Arab nations have also tried boycotting Israeli and American products.

In the past it's been argued the importance of maintaining close exchanges and high trade levels to be in a better position to resolve issues through dialogue and consultation, this has also failed in China's case and they continue to ramp up their global expansion while committing ethnic genocide, IP theft, suppression of free speech and many other atrocities regularly.

New Zealand expanding our own manufacturing industry to a degree to where a significant amount of products will be made locally is unrealistic but purchasing local where possible and from countries with more ethical governments drives innovation and expansion upon demand.

-----------------------------

**Below are some examples of alternative products many which are stocked in New Zealand and others available to order online. I've tried to make sure everything up to date but with companies constantly changing manufacturing processes and issues with transparency there may be some discrepancies, feel free to correct anything and I'll edit.**

Many of these products may still include Chinese components but it's about minimizing not perfection. For example Samsung has no direct manufacturing plants left in China but given around 80% of global supply of rare metals used in phones is from China some components in Samsung phones are still made in China, the majority is not for many of their products.

These are just some of the many alternative brands available to give you an idea of options, check with the supplier before purchasing to confirm country origin. 

In regards to **computer parts**, non Chinese made CPU, memory, and SSD are easy to find in NZ and many of the ones available are made in Taiwan, Singapore, Germany and the US. Cases, motherboards, fans, graphics cards and power supplies are more difficult but again reducing and buying a product with Chinese made components is better than buying a product fully manufactured in China. Intel, PNY, Patriot all manufactured in the US. EIZO from Japan make great monitors. ASUS, ASROCK, ACER and Gigabyte are made in Taiwan mostly although ASUS does produce some products in China. Western Digital are mostly made in Malaysia. Kingston, ADATA and Samsung flash drives and hard drives are mostly made in Taiwan and Mediasonic in Japan.

A lot of Epson **printers** are made in Indonesia or Philippines and many Canon printers are made in Korea, Thailand and Japan.

For **cameras** Fuji is usually made in Japan, Hasselblad in Sweden, Leica from Germany and Portugal, Alpa made in Switzerland and Arri from Germany. Canon stuff is made mostly in Taiwan and Malaysia and Profoto lights are made in Sweden. Lots of high end Nikon are still made in Japan, most mid to high end lenses too.

Sony make many of their **headphones** in Malaysia now, some of Samsungs range are made in Vietnam, Beyerdynamic are great headphones from Germany, Klipsch, Ultrasone make some in Germany and Taiwan but also some in China. There's also Dali made in Denmark and Fostex made in Japan. 

Garmin has many NZ stockists and are manufactured in Taiwan and the US I believe, great **smartwatches** and other wrist worn devices.

China produces an around 40 billion **ballpoint pens** annually but there's also options like Pentel from Japan and Rotring made in Japan and Germany available in NZ if you purchase office supplies.

For **gardening tools** there's Garant Botanica from Canada, Berger, Bahcoand Sneeboer all from Europe and non Chinese gardening tools can be found easily in NZ.

**Coffee machines**, there's Nespresso usually made in Ukraine and Switzerland, AeroPress made in the US, QuickMill and Bialetti from Italy and Thailand and all these brands are available in New Zealand.

For **power tools** there's Bosch which are often made in Hungary, Poland, Germany and Switzerland but still some made in China. Dremel from Mexico and Swisstools from Switzerland. Kress, Festool and Metabo are made mostly in Germany. Some of these are widely available in New Zealand and some aren't, request them from hardware stores you use and they'll stock more when aware of demand.

Non Chinese made **phones** can be difficult to source in New Zealand but there are options. Some to look out for would be the LG G8X ThinQ, LG Stylo 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10 from South Korea, Librem 5, Pixel 4a, ASUS ROG made in Taiwan, Iphone SE2, Samsung Galaxy M31, Samsung M21, Fairphone 3, some Sony Xperia are made in Japan and Moto G Stylus mostly made in India. Again, these mostly contain some level of components made in China and the origins of international versions can vary so check with suppliers before purchasing.

Oster, Wahl and Panasonic have some **hair clippers** not made in China and are easy enough to find from NZ stores. 

BlackVue and Thinkware **dashcam cameras** are designed and made in South Korea and Transcend are made in Taiwan. 

As for **sunglasses** some good brands to look at are Derapage, Salt from Japan, Zeiss germany, Maui Jim is designed in the US and manufactured in Italy and Japan.

Blendtec, Beurer and KitchenAid are good options for **appliances** although some KitchenAid are made in China. Zojirushi from Japan are not cheap but great quality and products, not widely available in NZ but I've seen them at a few stores and online NZ retailers.

A lot of Samsung **TV's** are made in Thailand and Malaysia, LG do some in China but also Poland. Check with the NZ store you're buying from before purchasing.

In terms of **food** I find it reasonably easy to find alternatives although Chinese produces for 62% of world’s ginger exports and 80% of the imported garlic worldwide comes from China. Thai, Brazilian and Peruvian ginger is available and of better quality with similar prices. Countdown stock some minced Brazilian garlic but the Healthy N Fresh brand at Pak N Save is a product of the PRC.

For **PPE** there's 3M (N95 - Model 8210, Nexcare series only), Banale, Banitore, Comfort, Cross Protection, Crosstex, CSD, Halyard, Haofa, Kowa, Tricare, UdiLife and Mocacare and many more. Not widely stocked in NZ stores but available online.

Also if you're a twitter user you can search for the hashtag 'abc_challenge' which is a good resource to find non Chinese made products.

2024-11-10,2024-11-10 02:19:22,Reddit,search_result,wallstreetbets,"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.","You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) &lt;-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\*\*

\*\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\*\*

\*\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\*\*\*

","Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally. You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) &lt;-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\*\*

\*\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\*\*

\*\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\*\*\*

2025-07-17,2025-07-17 09:24:54,Reddit,search_result,phinvest,MEGATHREAD: 20% Withholding Tax on INTEREST for Peso Deposits,"The 20% withholding tax (WHT) on PESO deposit interest (take note: on interest only) has already been in place for the longest time since the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, the grand-daddy of Philippine taxation laws (which by the way, was the law wherein we had that faulty income tax max at 35% before 2018 with that child deductions).

Just to clear the air out:

\* The 20% WHT for peso interest income, which covers your typical bank PESO deposits, bonds, time deposits, basically any interest income was already existing before CMEPA. What is new is the removal of tax-exemption for long-term PESO time deposits beyond 5 years and bonds issued by banks. For context, these exemptions were designed to encourage savings in the past.

\* The 15% rate floating around was the previous WHT for FOREIGN CURRENCY deposits/interest income. Before 2018, it was at 7.5%. When TRAIN 1 was implemented, which also adjusted income tax brackets, this rate was adjusted higher to 15%. Now, CMEPA levelled out the WHT to make it same as PESO at 20%. To be honest, I was hoping for the PESO WHT to go down and match the FOREIGN CURRENCY WHT at 15%. That would've been better. But instead, they opted to adjust FOREIGN CURRENCY WHT higher to match the PESO instead at 20%. The apparent rationale in the past was to encourage foreign currency flows to the country by offering preferential lower taxes on interest income.

\* As other Redditors already pointed out, MP2 is still exempt from PESO WHT as indicated by the PAG-IBIG Charter (h/o to u/esonn85), to cite:

REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9679, July 21, 2009

July 9, 2025
His Excellency
Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.
President of the Republic of the Philippines
Manila

Dear Mr. President:

It is a Great Honor for me to send you this letter in that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship, and the fact that the United States of America has agreed to continue working with the Philippines, despite having a significant Trade Deficit with your great Country. Nevertheless, we have decided to move forward with you, but only with more balanced, and fair, TRADE. Therefore, we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States, the Number One Market in the World, by far. We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with the Philippines, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, and very persistent, Trade Deficits engendered by the Philippines' Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers. Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal. Starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge the Philippines a Tariff of only 20% on any and all Philippine products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs.

Goods transshipped to evade a higher Tariff will be subject to that higher Tariff. Please understand that the 20% number is far less than what is needed to eliminate the Trade Deficit disparity we have with your Country. As you are aware, there will be no Tariff if the Philippines, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely - In other words, in a matter of weeks.

If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 20% that we charge. Please understand that these Tariffs are necessary to correct the many years of the Philippines' Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, causing these unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States. This Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!

We look forward to working with you as your Trading Partner for many years to come. If you wish to open your heretofore closed Trading Markets to the United States, and eliminate your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter. These Tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country. You will never be disappointed with The United States of America.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!

With best wishes, I am,

Sincerely,

DONALD J. TRUMP
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

First of all, I did not know that we have a significant favorable trade deficit vs. the US. I’m aware of wire harness manufacturers (like Yazaki Torres) as the perennial, hugh-volume, dependable exporter of wire harness to the US’s auto-industry. 

Add here the semicon companies—which are US subsidiaries on the first place (though group does not include Intel anymore), and enjoy full PEZA privileges. So, I’m quite surprised at the implied indignance of Trump’s letter. 

And mehn, it’s like an email from a rookie negotiator, who’s a pure evil narcissist freshly appointed to his post. When I see approaches like this in nego, I know that the bully might achieve a short-term win, but comeuppance especially on goods with seasonality will always happen. And the tone is just ridiculous. Haha. 

In any case, if our government even has an ounce of care, it should assemble and sincerely and technically consult with all the semicon companies to be affected upfront. They should be able to convene easily. 

Make sure there’s no threat on the jobs in the remaining semicon plants we have, most of all. Protect the headcounts in each plant. 

If PH intend to nego the tariffs, the numbers that will inform our position should come from this consultation as well.

The small agri-sector which exports to the US I can imagine can just add the +20% outright to their prices. 

I’m curious to hear firsthand info here from people working in plants that substantially export to the US. What’s the immediate reaction in your firm?

I bought a renovated house from the secondhand market via cash (DP + installment payments direct to the seller for 1 year). Yes, my husband and I are high earners, but we opted for a 4M starter home as I know that there will be extra costs in getting a house.

# Due diligence

* No banks were involved in the purchase. Next time, I will definitely involve the bank so they can do the verification themselves.
* **Reservation -** My first mistake. I really liked the property and paid reservation fees right away after 2 visits. This is stupid. You have the upperhand because it’s hard to sell a real estate property. Take your time in checking everything, negotiate for lower price and CGT to be handled by seller.
* **Property inspection -** As the house was renovated, I had to check the following: plumbing, electricity, pests, waterproofing, sewage system and water lines. Just ask ChatGPT on what to check or bring a contractor to give you an estimate of the issues.
* **Community issues -** I joined Facebook groups (HOA or buy &amp; sell groups) to check the usual prices of utility bills, common issues with the admin, best internet service providers, flooding, crimes, etc.
* **Floods and fault lines -** I also checked Project Noah to see if the area is prone to flooding or will flood in the future. Check Tiktoks, youtube videos and facebook posts!
* **Property appreciation -** Future plans in the area were also considered, such as new expressways or malls being built nearby.

# Are you getting scammed?

* **Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) -** The seller may only have the TCT if they are the second owner. You should verify the TCT at the Registry of Deeds (RD) yourself as it only takes three days and costs Php 300 pesos. You just need to show photocopy of TCT, ID of owner and amilyar. Most people complain that the RDs have long lines but it's short if you're just going verification of TCT, unlike for cancellation or transfer of title. Don’t trust the agents on this, you have to do this yourself. The seller should have a version of the TCT called the ""owner’s copy"" with them.
   * If the title is really clean, there won’t be any encumbrances. If it's not, then it's not clean. Our title had a mortgage encumbrance on it, which made me worry. I went to a lawyer and he said that if they give a notarized ""cancellation of mortgage,"" that’s good enough and we can clean it ourselves.
   * Tax Declaration - They will show you the “amilyar” or the receipt to show that it’s paid recently. You can go to Assessor's Office to verify that. We didn’t go anymore because it’s just Php 1000 per year and we got lazy. Lawyer doesn’t need this, more on that later.

# Best way to pay?

* Pay via bank. The costliest way to buy a property is with cash, but I just moved back so I can't really take out a loan.
* A manager's check is recommended, especially if you're paying in millions. Don't pay with cash. This is as good as cash, and only the owner can deposit it into their bank. It's safer than post-dated checks too.
* Thanks to you guys, I learned that there's no limit to post-dated checks in the Philippines, so the balance is being paid in PDCs over a year.

# Legal Stuff

* **Contract to Sell** is created if the property is in installment and notary offices charge 1% of the property value, you can negotiate.
   * **Verify notary firm -** Don’t be cheap here. I switched notary firms because I don’t trust the cheap notary office they recommended - no Google reviews, new firm and they also have a coffee shop. We opted for a lawyer with a notary office who's been in the same building since I was a kid. Of course, he cares more about our interest and put a lot of buyer protection clauses. It's much easier to pay more for a legit lawyer than chase a runaway seller!
   * **Review all info before signing** \- Ensure that the title number, ID numbers, seller's and buyers name are correct.
   * **Terms** \- It should itemize all of the payment terms and all of the documents that the seller needs to provide
   * **Seller's deliverables:** All keys, old deed of sale from previous owner, notarized cancelation of mortgage, meralco bill, water bill, certificate of tax declaration for lot and building (those two are separate), TCT from RD, authority to move in. Seller will hold the owner’s copy of TCT until you’re paid or depends on your negotiation. Safest way is to keep it in a safe or add an encumbrance saying it's under a contract of sale, kasi they can still mortgage the property or sell it to another person.
   * **Move-in requirements:** It's important to check with the admin office or homeowner's association about their requirements for moving in and to ensure that the seller can provide any necessary documents or certifications during the contract selling process. This may include things like proof of ownership, water or electricity bills, clearance from the barangay or homeowner's association, and more.

# Transfer of Title

You should only get the DOAS after it’s fully paid or else you’ll get penalties as some taxes are due within 30 days of notarization. The previous notary wanted to issue this right away 🤦‍♀️ We'll probably just hire the same law firm to handle this for us.

&amp;#x200B;

|Fees in transferring the title|Description|Deadline|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Deed of Absolute Sale|Additional 1% fee, executed once property is fully paid|Within 30 days to start transfer of title process|
|Documentary Stamp Tax (DST)|1.5% of selling price|5th day after notarizing DOAS|
|Registration Fees|0.5% of selling price||
|Notary Fees|1% to 1.5% of selling price||
|Capital Gains Tax (CGT)|6% of selling price ⚠️ Yes, it’s **6 percent** that’s why this is generally negotiated with the seller, let them pay for it haha. Most notary offices will execute DOAS showing half of the total contract price so they can save in the CGT and that’s completely fine.|Within 30 days after notarization of DOAS|
|Transfer Tax|0.75% of selling price|varies depending on municipality area, 60 days after notarizing DOAS|
|Real Property Tax (RPT)||Must be updated before transfer of title for payment of transfer tax|

**Make room in your budget for unexpected expenses:**

* This is why we opted for a more affordable property to allow some room for unexpected expenses. As you can see, legal fees alone can cost quite a bit.
* After closing, consider your furniture needs, then appliances, and finally any necessary repairs or upgrades such as a fence or window grills.

This was scary and stressful for us, and I hope this helps! It's funny, if we had just spent this much time buying stocks, we would have been multimillionaires by now haha.","Everything I Learned Buying A House in the Philippines # Background

2025-01-29,2025-01-29 14:07:21,Reddit,search_result,Philippines,"Gov’t to go bankrupt, Filipinos to go hungrier","Politicos and bureaucrats misspend trillions of pesos each year.

At the rate they’re going, they’ll bankrupt the government.

In 2024 they budgeted P5.768 trillion. Short of revenues by 42.65 percent, they borrowed P2.46 trillion.

This 2025 they budgeted P6.326 trillion. Again short by 40.23 percent, they’ll borrow P2.545 trillion.


Imagine a family spending P6,326 every week, but having to loan two-fifths of it, or P2,545. It would soon keel over.

By yearend, total public debt, including past admins, will be P17.353 trillion. It will overshoot P20 trillion by the time President Bongbong Marcos steps down in 2028.

How will poor, hungry, undereducated Filipinos repay that?

Politicos and bureaucrats steal at least 20 percent of yearly budgets, the IMF and World Bank long reported.

In 2024 they looted P1.153 trillion – from public works and political ayuda, among others. They engaged in “7-7-7” and “30-30-30” rackets from June to December.

This 2025 they’ll plunder P1.265 trillion.

With their loot they buy nonessentials – signature bags, jewelry, machine pistols, luxury cars, mansions – all with no strategic development effect.

They only burden the economy. No care for the people.

Last Christmastime two in three families rated themselves poor, and one in four starved. Those are SWS’s worst poverty and hunger stats since 2003 and 2020, respectively.

Seventy-six million Filipinos tightened their belts. Food, water, medicines, schooling, electricity, gas, clothing, groceries, rent and repairs costs shot up.

Rice sold at more than P60 a kilo – three times BBM’s campaign lie of P20. The poor had to eat less.

Congressmen, senators and Cabinet members blamed it all on typhoons. Yet they’re the real culprits.

Every year they steal hundreds of billions of pesos in flood funds. In his July 2024 State of the Nation, BBM bragged about 5,500 completed flood works. All ghost, it turned out.

Two days of heavy rain ensued. Floods deepened and widened. People lost homes, shops, farms, businesses, belongings, livelihoods. Work, commerce, tourism halted. Evacuation facilities and relief goods were inadequate.

People’s misery multiplied.

Plunderers didn’t stop. They took P60 billion of an intended P90 billion from PhilHealth. Plus, P717 billion from Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. All to put into overpriced highway rock nettings, cat’s eyes and roller safety barriers.

The previous year they already pillaged P50 billion from Landbank, P25 billion from DBP and P50 billion from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

BSP had to sell 25 tons of gold, and its governor left. DBP suddenly had no more money for rural business loans, and its chairman also left. Landbank became undercapitalized; salaries and deposits of government employees, public school teachers, health workers, soldiers, policemen and retirees’ pensions are in peril.

They even played with rice. Last June, BBM slashed import tariffs from 35 to only 15 percent. By yearend 2024, Customs collections dropped P14.5 billion.

By law, that money could’ve gone to productivity aid to 2.4 million rice farmers. It’s what consumers could’ve saved in buying the staple.

Instead, a rice cartel profiteered P14.5 billion. A high Customs official colluded with a handful of importers-wholesalers to control three-fourths of the trade. They have a Very Influential Protector in Malacañang.

Now they’re making a show of solving the rice price crisis. The Department of Agriculture imposed a price cap of P58 per kilo of imported stock. DA forcibly will lessen it to P50 in February and P40 in March.

Market vendors will bear the brunt of price control, since importers-wholesalers sell high to them. Officials warn them about the new law that prescribes life imprisonment on overpricers.

For good measure, Sec. Francis Tiu Laurel ordered the National Food Authority to sell its emergency buffer stocks at only P40 per kilo.

At that rate NFA will lose P7 per kilo, or P2.331 billion, from its fire sale of 333,000 tons.

Now NFA must buy domestic palay to replenish its stock – 15 days’ worth, no longer just nine, under a new law. It needs P18 billion for that. But its budget for 2025 is only P9 billion.

But politicos and bureaucrats don’t worry about that. They’ve allocated to themselves political ayuda: P26-billion AKAP, P15-billion TUPAD, P45-billion AICS – all for vote buying in May.","Gov’t to go bankrupt, Filipinos to go hungrier Politicos and bureaucrats misspend trillions of pesos each year.

&gt;While Donald Trump took questions from the press at the White House Monday afternoon, the stock market plummeted, and Fox News displayed a graphic showing the dip while carrying Trump’s remarks live. 

&gt;Trump told reporters that he planned to enact his long-threatened 25 percent tariffs against goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 percent tariffs against goods from China starting Tuesday, to which the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 did not respond well. Fox News, along with their usual breaking news chyron, also had the Dow index displayed while Trump was speaking, showing a fall of more than 650 points.

&gt;Trump’s remarks were preceded by his early afternoon announcement on Truth Social addressed to “the Great Farmers of the United States.” 

&gt;“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump posted. But it seems that there was little fun to be had in the stock market based on the fears of higher prices and other  negative ripple effects.

&gt;This, coupled with fewer food imports from three of America’s largest trading partners, will ultimately lead to higher food prices across the country, something that Trump campaigned against during the 2024 election and that ultimately played a factor in his victory. Plus, the prices of various other goods, from cars to electronics to over-the-counter pills, also will likely see a sharp increase. 

&gt;Don’t expect Trump to take responsibility for a sinking stock market or higher prices, though. He’s already saying that rising inflation isn’t his fault and has tacitly admitted that his tariffs will cause prices to go up. His administration is even discussing how to juke economic numbers to try and hide how badly Trump’s radical changes, including those from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, are hurting the economy. It looks like our wallets are about to have a rough spring.","Fox News displays a ticker showing the live collapse of the stock market with every word Trump has said, announcing tariffs on allies. https://newrepublic.com/post/192261/fox-news-stock-market-tanks-trump-press-conference

I haven’t been to the Philippines since early 2022 and came back for a visit and was shocked at the price of medicine in the metro Manila area.

&gt;Late-night hosts assess Donald Trump’s level of authoritarianism as his administration refuses to follow a supreme court order to return a wrongfully deported man from a prison in El Salvador.

&gt;Jon Stewart returned to his Monday night perch at The Daily Show to skewer the Trump administration for their deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man and legal US resident the White House admits was wrongfully sent to El Salvador due to “administrative error”.

&gt;Speaking at the White House with the Salvadorian president, Nayib Bukele, Trump refused to return Garcia despite a supreme court order to do so. Bukele said: “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.”

&gt;“The thing is, they’re fucking enjoying this,” Stewart said. “Like the two of them – our president, their president. ‘I guess we’ll just have to let him rot in a fucking prison even though he didn’t deserve to be there.’ I know you guys don’t care about this guy – I’m talking about these two – but somebody else cares about this person. And you just randomly, with no evidence that you’ll show anybody, called him a terrorist.”

&gt;“And one of the weirder parts about this is, the only thing that seems to upset Trump about the entire situation is having to answer a perfectly reasonable question from Kaitlan Collins about it,” he continued. Asked by Collins if he would get Garcia back, Trump responded: “Why don’t you just say, isn’t it wonderful that we’re keeping criminals out of our country? … That’s why nobody watches you anymore.”

&gt;“But fear not, America, for every time a lamestream media journalist gets shunned, and ass-kissy one gets its wings,” Stewart quipped, before another clip of Trump saying he had no issue deporting “really bad people” and “homegrown criminals”.

&gt;“He’s going to do that to US citizens. I think the hosts of The View are about to get administratively errored,” Stewart said. “I’ve got to tell you: I did not think that he would get this authoritarian this fast.”

&gt;Stewart thus introduced a new game called How Authoritarian Is We? “Trump’s done a lot of the standard fare,” he said. “He’s attacked the free press, pulled random people off the streets, made law firms and universities bend the knee, launched Department of Justice investigations into an individual whose sole crime was suggesting that the 2020 election had been safe and well-administered.

&gt;“Luckily for us, the world is full of authoritarian leaders that we can measure Trump against: your Putins, your Xis, your Anna Wintours,” he continued. “The calling card of an authoritarian regime is that you must suspend that reality, that rationality, and then you test people by pushing the limits of that absurdity.”

&gt;Such as Trump’s annual physical, in which he received “excellent” marks for physical and cognitive health examinations. Stewart called BS: “No. I’m going to say no to either of those numbers. I don’t want to be that guy, but he has a front butt. I mean, we all get there.”

&gt;“So Trump’s got it all, authoritarian-wise: the looks, the attitude, the relentless dissent-crushing – all the ingredients to be a top-tier authoritarian. All he needs now is to bring it home with his ruthless competence,” Stewart concluded, before a supercut of headlines on the tariff chaos and ensuing stock market drop, plane crashes, ongoing measles outbreak and firings by the so-called “department of government efficiency”. “So close!”

I consider myself an amateur researcher/scientist with a passion for cooking, baking, and inventing stuff. At best, a poet; at worst, an artist. During the pandemic, with nothing better to do at home, I dedicated my energy to my love for ice cream—Filipino Sorbetes, Western Custard Ice Cream, Turkish Kulfi, Sorbets, Soft Serve, Popsicles, Mochi. If it’s ice cream, I’ve made it. Any flavor? No problem. Any dietary restrictions? How about a lactose free, sugar free alternative? Any food you want turned into ice cream? Done. I made bamboo-flavored ice cream—possibly a first here and abroad. Black Charcoal sorbetes? I’m proud to say I’m the first in the Philippines to have made it using lab-tested, food-grade activated charcoal.

During the pandemic, I realized there was a massive market for good commercial ice cream. Not high-end, gourmet, expensive stuff mind you, but ice cream that’s better than the junk that Nestlé and Selecta peddle to the masses. Ever wonder why their ice cream feels slimy, gummy, and bland to eat? That’s because they’re skimping on ingredients and feeding you air and lies. But there is a massive goldmine just waiting to be tapped with dirty ice cream I'm surprised no one has capitalized on yet. Simply because my recipe uses better and cleaner techniques and ingredients to achieve a higher profit margin than competitors.

With that knowledge, I started an ice cream business and found early success. I also managed to develop an entirely new type of Filipino ice cream—one that combines Western technology with Filipino techniques, has a higher profit margin than common ice creams in the market, and offers a better flavor selection. However, I soon realized that I’m not cut out for business. I’m too kind. Too forgiving. I was blindsided by unreliable partners, betrayed by friends who wanted my recipe, and ultimately lost the company I started. And worst of all, I failed to get any major contracts signed. (Please don't berate me on this massive mistake, I already suffered enough).

Back when the popular ice cream vendor in Davao, Mang Danny, was still alive, he was offered 6M for his recipe. He didn’t sell, of course; who would in their right mind? Well, I’m in a rough spot right now. I haven’t made good ice cream in weeks due to the stress of dealing with business partners and their bullshit. And I realized that I just wanted to make ice cream, so that’s right, I’m selling...

If any mods want to delete this post if it breaks the rules, please proceed. But otherwise, I can provide credentials and name the company that I started (Yes, the company is doing great, flourishing even, just not what I had envisioned my ice cream, my baby, to be).

I can also name the congressman who commissioned that bamboo ice cream and provide pics for that event. \*That’s a massive hint right there of who I am. \*\*And the lab tests and certificates of our activated charcoal

So yes, if you’re interested in taking the recipe off my hands, please do. So far, it’s only given me heartbreak. I'd prefer it if I could have my friends and people I consider to be my family back. But I guess money is more important to them than relationships...

The recipe is, as the younger kids say nowadays, simply designed and built different. Meaning, other competitor's ice cream just won't be able to compete as efficiently due to the basic nature of what the recipe is and isn't. What’s more, it’s versatile enough to expand beyond traditional scoops. This could include premium packaged pints, artisan popsicles, or even a high-demand catering line.

I don't like to kick other competitors when they are down, and I think they can still improve, but MyChoice Ice Cream uses bad coconut oil that makes their ice cream horrible. **So to try to summarize a TLDR; I am selling the secret recipe, the techniques, business insights and knowledge, a business plan similar to My Choice's, and my expertise..**

# WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR DISCOUNTS

While California launches campaigns citing a decline in tourism because of President Donald Trump's policies, seeking to remind Canadians that they welcome us, telling us ""Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in D.C., but don't let that ruin your beach plans,""[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists)[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists) we have one response:

We don't want your discount codes and coupons. We want respect.

Despite Visit California acknowledging recent Canada-U.S. tensions ""due in large part to the ongoing trade dispute sparked by United States President Donald Trump and his administration,"" their message that ""you are missed, you are deeply valued and you're always welcome in California""[\[9\]](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/california-trying-attract-canadian-travellers-220828660.html) rings hollow.

Even as Bellingham City Council and Mayor Kim Lund write that they hope the ""peaceful partnership"" between Canada and Bellingham will continue[\[1\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bellingham-letter-bc-cities-1.7545411), they miss the point entirely.

# THIS ISN'T ABOUT ""HURT FEELINGS""

This is not about being offended. This is about being threatened.

When the President of the United States says he would wage economic war against Canada - and he's doing it - we are in a state of war.[\[5\]](https://abcnews.go.com/International/trade-wars-threats-annexation-trump-changing-canadas-election/story?id=121125965)

When asked if the U.S. still wants to make Canada the 51st state, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded: ""I think the President has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state."" Canada has also countered with a 25% tariff on goods imported from the U.S.[\[10\]](https://time.com/7280793/does-trump-plan-to-annex-canada-marco-rubio-51st-state-comments/)

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump: ""There are some places that are never for sale. Canada is not for sale and won't be for sale ever."" The exchange showed the newly elected prime minister refusing to budge on an issue that has created a swell of Canadian pride and fueled anger against the United States.[\[7\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/trump-canada-carney-tariffs-trade.html)

# CROSSING YOUR BORDER HAS BECOME DANGEROUS

German tourists Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère were detained and strip-searched before being deported by U.S. border authorities in Hawaii. According to German media reports, border police handcuffed and strip-searched the women before detaining them overnight and eventually deporting them to Japan at their own request.[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)

U.S. border officials denied entry for Nicolle Saroukos, a military wife who says she was ""treated like a criminal."" Officials told her that she ""had too many clothes in her suitcase"" and ""because of that, they assumed that she was going to overstay her visa."" When told she would be denied entry, an officer said ""we're going to send you to a prison overnight where you will stay. Not detention center, he said prison.""[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)

On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee's US-Mexico border program, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he's never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this. ""It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.""[\[4\]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america)

# YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

There is no provision under U.S. law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,"" said University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert. Trump told reporters he ""loved"" the idea of deporting citizens to El Salvador.[\[1\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-wants-deport-some-us-citizens-el-salvador-2025-04-14/)

U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff cited horrendous living conditions documented in Salvadoran prisons, where inmates often lack access to proper sanitation, temperature control and even potable water. ""It would be a moral and legal travesty for the U.S. government to subject anyone to such conditions,"" Ossoff wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union has also described the concept as a legal nonstarter: ""You may not deport a U.S. citizen, period,"" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told NPR.[\[7\]](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador)

The Trump administration's actions have created a heightened level of fear and uncertainty for immigrants legal and unauthorized alike, their families, and communities. Even U.S. citizens have been caught up in arrests and fear deportation, particularly as Trump has called for removing ""homegrown"" citizens with criminal convictions to El Salvador, in a move that would be wholly unprecedented.[\[9\]](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-2-immigration-first-100-days)

# THE RELATIONSHIP IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED

Canada's Mark Carney says relationship with the U.S. is changed forever. President Donald Trump's tariff war - and his repeated threats to annex Canada - are upending decades of close trade ties between the two North American neighbors.[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)

Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's plea and his ad campaign, B.C. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon had a message for British Columbians: ""Hold the line. It's working. There's a reason why there's an ad campaign being run by the California state. There's a reason why there's ads being run by U.S. states. It's because Canadians have responded with a clear message: we're not a 51st state, we're not going to take this lightly, we believe all the tariffs should come off.""[\[4\]](https://globalnews.ca/news/11132762/california-ad-campaign-canadian-travellers/)

As one B.C. resident said about visiting Bellingham: ""A lot of us are simply scared of your border guards and ICE agents. There is nothing that a city or even a state can do to control them. So until that changes, a lot of us just won't visit, which is a damn shame.""[\[7\]](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bellingham-bc-travel-letter)

# OUR MESSAGE TO AMERICA

We don't want your coupons or your open letters. We want you to fix your country.

Your President has threatened our sovereignty, imposed punitive tariffs, and created a dangerous border environment.

Until your government changes course, not just your words, we'll be staying home and spending our money in Canada.

This isn't a temporary boycott. This is a fundamental shift in our relationship.

No discount is worth our dignity or our safety.

It's just not happening, Your Crocodile Tears Won't Fix This
A MESSAGE FROM CANADIANS TO AMERICA Canadians have sharply curtailed vacation plans south of the border amid an ongoing tariff war with the United States, a comparatively weak dollar, reports of travellers being detained by U.S. officials, and Trump openly musing about annexing the country.[\[5\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/california-governor-gavin-newsom-tourism-1.7511176)

# WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR DISCOUNTS

While California launches campaigns citing a decline in tourism because of President Donald Trump's policies, seeking to remind Canadians that they welcome us, telling us ""Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in D.C., but don't let that ruin your beach plans,""[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists)[\[2\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/tourism/2025/04/15/visit-california-campaign-targets-canadian-tourists) we have one response:

We don't want your discount codes and coupons. We want respect.

Despite Visit California acknowledging recent Canada-U.S. tensions ""due in large part to the ongoing trade dispute sparked by United States President Donald Trump and his administration,"" their message that ""you are missed, you are deeply valued and you're always welcome in California""[\[9\]](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/california-trying-attract-canadian-travellers-220828660.html) rings hollow.

Even as Bellingham City Council and Mayor Kim Lund write that they hope the ""peaceful partnership"" between Canada and Bellingham will continue[\[1\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bellingham-letter-bc-cities-1.7545411), they miss the point entirely.

# THIS ISN'T ABOUT ""HURT FEELINGS""

This is not about being offended. This is about being threatened.

When the President of the United States says he would wage economic war against Canada - and he's doing it - we are in a state of war.[\[5\]](https://abcnews.go.com/International/trade-wars-threats-annexation-trump-changing-canadas-election/story?id=121125965)

When asked if the U.S. still wants to make Canada the 51st state, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded: ""I think the President has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state."" Canada has also countered with a 25% tariff on goods imported from the U.S.[\[10\]](https://time.com/7280793/does-trump-plan-to-annex-canada-marco-rubio-51st-state-comments/)

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump: ""There are some places that are never for sale. Canada is not for sale and won't be for sale ever."" The exchange showed the newly elected prime minister refusing to budge on an issue that has created a swell of Canadian pride and fueled anger against the United States.[\[7\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/trump-canada-carney-tariffs-trade.html)

# CROSSING YOUR BORDER HAS BECOME DANGEROUS

German tourists Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère were detained and strip-searched before being deported by U.S. border authorities in Hawaii. According to German media reports, border police handcuffed and strip-searched the women before detaining them overnight and eventually deporting them to Japan at their own request.[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)[\[1\]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/22/german-tourists-hawaii-deported/)

U.S. border officials denied entry for Nicolle Saroukos, a military wife who says she was ""treated like a criminal."" Officials told her that she ""had too many clothes in her suitcase"" and ""because of that, they assumed that she was going to overstay her visa."" When told she would be denied entry, an officer said ""we're going to send you to a prison overnight where you will stay. Not detention center, he said prison.""[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)[\[5\]](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/24/im-not-criminal-australian-woman-recounts-detention-experience-while-trying-visit-us-military-spouse-hawaii/)

On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee's US-Mexico border program, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he's never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this. ""It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.""[\[4\]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america)

# YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

There is no provision under U.S. law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,"" said University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert. Trump told reporters he ""loved"" the idea of deporting citizens to El Salvador.[\[1\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-wants-deport-some-us-citizens-el-salvador-2025-04-14/)

U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff cited horrendous living conditions documented in Salvadoran prisons, where inmates often lack access to proper sanitation, temperature control and even potable water. ""It would be a moral and legal travesty for the U.S. government to subject anyone to such conditions,"" Ossoff wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union has also described the concept as a legal nonstarter: ""You may not deport a U.S. citizen, period,"" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told NPR.[\[7\]](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador)

The Trump administration's actions have created a heightened level of fear and uncertainty for immigrants legal and unauthorized alike, their families, and communities. Even U.S. citizens have been caught up in arrests and fear deportation, particularly as Trump has called for removing ""homegrown"" citizens with criminal convictions to El Salvador, in a move that would be wholly unprecedented.[\[9\]](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-2-immigration-first-100-days)

# THE RELATIONSHIP IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED

Canada's Mark Carney says relationship with the U.S. is changed forever. President Donald Trump's tariff war - and his repeated threats to annex Canada - are upending decades of close trade ties between the two North American neighbors.[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)[\[6\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tariffs-sink-canadian-companies-pivot-us-new-markets-2025-05-06/)

Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's plea and his ad campaign, B.C. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon had a message for British Columbians: ""Hold the line. It's working. There's a reason why there's an ad campaign being run by the California state. There's a reason why there's ads being run by U.S. states. It's because Canadians have responded with a clear message: we're not a 51st state, we're not going to take this lightly, we believe all the tariffs should come off.""[\[4\]](https://globalnews.ca/news/11132762/california-ad-campaign-canadian-travellers/)

As one B.C. resident said about visiting Bellingham: ""A lot of us are simply scared of your border guards and ICE agents. There is nothing that a city or even a state can do to control them. So until that changes, a lot of us just won't visit, which is a damn shame.""[\[7\]](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bellingham-bc-travel-letter)

# OUR MESSAGE TO AMERICA

We don't want your coupons or your open letters. We want you to fix your country.

Your President has threatened our sovereignty, imposed punitive tariffs, and created a dangerous border environment.

Until your government changes course, not just your words, we'll be staying home and spending our money in Canada.

This isn't a temporary boycott. This is a fundamental shift in our relationship.

No discount is worth our dignity or our safety.

EDIT:

1. I'm not saying this is good for the Philippines. Obviously it will have a negative effect on our exports to the US. My point is that this is being sold by Trump and the Republicans as ""other countries paying the tariffs"".

2. Sure, the tariffs MIGHT be partially absorbed by the exporter and/or the importing companies, but they won't be doing that for long, if they even do it. Remember, a business' main goal is to make money. And the only way they will make money is to raise prices. Heck, some businesses have already raised prices even if they aren't affected by tarrifs.

3. Yes tarrifs can be a way to encourage businesses to move their manufacturing locally, but what Trump is doing is just randomly dishing out numbers to random countries. There is no ""long term economic plan"" other than to grift and enrich the already super rich.


This is also why they passed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"". Raise the debt ceiling to borrow more money, slash taxes for the billionaires, and destroy public services.

Seeing the comments about overseas Pinoys mostly voting MAGA is very disheartening. You left the Philippines because of the rampant corruption, and that you thought there was no opportunity for you to prosper there, yet you actively want the same shit to happen to your new home countries.

It's time to do some self reflection.","So, Americans will pay an extra 20% or more for products from the Philippines. Got it.
