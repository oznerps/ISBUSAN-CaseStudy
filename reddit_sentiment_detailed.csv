Here is a list of all the current collapses:

1. **France** \-  Causes [Politics ](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/view-frances-government-collapses-after-losing-confidence-vote-2024-12-04/)(ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier based on austerity budget )
2. **South Korea** \-  Causes [Martial Law](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/south-korea-night-political-drama-turmoil-rcna182770?form=MG0AV3) (President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempt to impose martial law)
3. **The Philippines** \-  Causes [VP](https://apnews.com/article/philippines-marcos-duterte-assassination-threats-934fd103e380e1e1b7dad023ecd96ff2?form=MG0AV3) (Vice President Sara Duterte publicly threatened to have President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife assassinated - causing mass destabilization)
4. **Germany** \-  Causes [Coalition ](https://apnews.com/article/germany-government-economy-scholz-trump-8e7f77fe36d711d7192a8c96a4c41353?form=MG0AV3)(The collapse of Germany’s governing coalition).
5. **Georgia** \-  Causes [not joining EU](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/3/georgia-protests-whats-behind-them-and-whats-next?form=MG0AV3) (Tens of thousands protest against suspend negotiations to join EU)
6. (Older collapse news) **Ukraine** \- Causes land acquisition attempt by Russia
7. (Older collapse news) **Palestine** \- Causes US- funded Israeli occupation and aggression
8. (Older collapse news) **Sudan, DRC, Niger, Syria** \- Causes many
9. (Coming soon) **United States** \-  Causes a.) $36 trillion in debt, b.) Hyperinflation (tariffs + tax cuts = money printing/higher prices), c.) political upheaval
10. (Coming soon) **Canada** \- Causes (rising debt charges, higher interest rates, and concerns about financial stability)
11. (Coming soon) **Russia** \-  Causes Economy (Ruble falling due to sanctions)
12. (Coming soon) **UK** \- Causes a.) aging demographics b.) housing crisis c.) Economy
13. (Coming soon) **Italy** \-  Causes (scant GDP growth, political challenges)

The thing is, each of these are so diverse. It's not just G7 economies or Asia or Eastern Europe. For instance, the Philippines and South Korea's collapses are not caused by inflation or scaling wages. Also, France has such an extremely complex network of causes.

**My questions** are a.) Do you agree these are indicative of mass collapse? b.) Why is there so much apparent diversity in collapse causes?, c.) What do you think will come after this?

**Update:**    Thank you everyone for answering. Just to clarify:

1. There are various people who agreed with these and told their secrets for handling this - Thank you!
2. Various people have told me these are not collapse because governments are prone to be volatile - I don't think, say Ukraine being Invaded or the SK pres instituting martial law, etc. are everyday things but Thanks you for feedback!
3. Lastly, I see there's a culture here of climate doom specifically. Such that there were those who actually agree with me that collapse is happening but this list is invalid because I didn't include climate change or Donald Trump getting elected. To clarify , sure I think climate can be a cause not THE only cause of collapse. Also, MANY polities collapsed without current day climate alterations: Sumerians, Elamites, Babylonians, Phoenicians, Arameans, Egyptians, Aksumite Empire, Harappas, Dupta empire, Olmecs, Nazca, Incas, etc. You can completely have collapse (maybe even extinction) w/o climate being the cause. I understand this is important issue to many of you - I agree it's important. I think it's OK to agree to disagree that this is the only legitimate form of collapse given that such a vast amount of civilizations already collapsed not based on climate.

**Update II:**

In truth I wrote this because this essay ([here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-94137-6_6) \- it's open source) was my introduction to the notion of global collapse. I just couldn't believe I was seeing everything they discussed literally finally happening (tipping points, synchronous failures, contagions, cascades) so I thought to make this post because I believe ""we're finally here"".","Wow, collapse is happening right now.

2025-02-14,2025-02-14 00:49:58,Reddit,search_result,Aliexpress,"Chinese Sellers In Panic Over Trump Tariffs, Di Minimis","Since the Trump tariff Executive Orders, I have been interested in learning what Chinese sellers and platforms are thinking and doing in response. I learned finding out means finding sellers and sources directly connected to the e-commerce marketplace in China. One good source has been Waimaojia, a media platform for the cross-border e-commerce industry. That connection comes through a pricey subscription to the Bloomberg Business platform, which is used by logistics companies, professional buyers, and manufacturers to garner news and info that is more detailed than the general news articles that have been written about this issue.

First, a bit of news. Bloomberg reported yesterday that Temu and Shein are in total meltdown mode this week after watching sales completely crater in the United States. They estimate at least 33-40% sales drops for both the day after Trump announced new tariffs and they predict even bigger sales drops for other Chinese platforms like AliExpress, with suspicion sales collapsed even more after social media reports of consumers getting hit with big brokerage fees from UPS for inbound shipments. That has scared many consumers away from any platform that direct ships from China to the U.S. consumer, fearful of getting hit with a surprise bill.

Temu is ending all direct shipping from China from their own warehouses to U.S. consumers, moving entirely to “local sellers” which import, store, and ship products on their own in return for a $2.99 shipping fee for all orders under $30 FROM THAT SELLER. This is a Temu-killer, because almost nobody buys multiple items from a single seller, and most people are looking for goods under $20. That can mean enormous shipping fees on larger orders as Temu charges $2.99 for each seller, not for each order. Also, some local sellers are raising prices 25% because of tariffs and many existing Chinese sellers that depend on Temu for logistics are not going to sell to American customers any longer because they can’t or won’t run local warehouses.

Shein is moving sellers to move production to Vietnam to escape American tariffs on Chinese goods. Vietnam, however, does not have the capacity to ship Shein-level quantities of goods and believe it or not older Americans still have an emotional dislike of receiving products and packages from Vietnam. Shein is considering also shipping to the Philippines or Northern Mariana Islands or Guam to remail packages from there. 

Meanwhile, AliExpress is reported to be considering whether it should restrict non-Choice items from selling to the US. The anticipated brokerage fees and dramatically higher shipping costs may make non-Choice sales untenable to the United States. AliExpress needs to do damage control to guarantee customers will not be hit by surprise fees, which they can be if ordering from direct ship sellers. AliExpress already allows sellers to easily block orders for U.S. consumers with messages stating the product cannot be shipped or is unavailable so a change would be easy to implement. If adopted for U.S. customers, only Choice items would be available for purchase, which are already bulk shipped in containers to the U.S. 

Sellers have received regular updates about these changes and while the platforms are publicly downplaying the impact of losing American business, it is clear to Waimaojia the results will be devastating to Chinese manufacturers, especially smaller ones catering to dropshippers and budget minded consumers. They expect as much as 30% of manufacturing capacity targeting this market segment will close down permanently if the Trump tariffs apply to formerly di minimis-waived packages. The American market is by far the most important to Chinese sellers, even though they have made gains in Europe and Latin America. The Europeans are also cracking down on Chinese sellers over safety issues, so the heavy blows are not over yet.

Chinese sellers expect and are seeking retaliatory actions against the Trump Administration in hopes Trump will back down. Until now, there has been no effort to educate American consumers about how Trump’s policies will impact customers, but that may change. Temu has modified its late arrival discount, telling shoppers due to changes in tariffs and shipping rules, delays are expected with no compensation until the shipment exceeds 14 days past last expected arrival date. A new line item “tariffs and processing fees” tax applied to U.S. orders is also under discussion, but there are fears this would cause many customers to abandon their shopping carts. Retailers want consumers to blame the Trump Administration, not them.","Chinese Sellers In Panic Over Trump Tariffs, Di Minimis Since the Trump tariff Executive Orders, I have been interested in learning what Chinese sellers and platforms are thinking and doing in response.

EDIT:

1. I'm not saying this is good for the Philippines. Obviously it will have a negative effect on our exports to the US. My point is that this is being sold by Trump and the Republicans as ""other countries paying the tariffs"".

2. Sure, the tariffs MIGHT be partially absorbed by the exporter and/or the importing companies, but they won't be doing that for long, if they even do it. Remember, a business' main goal is to make money. And the only way they will make money is to raise prices. Heck, some businesses have already raised prices even if they aren't affected by tarrifs.

3. Yes tarrifs can be a way to encourage businesses to move their manufacturing locally, but what Trump is doing is just randomly dishing out numbers to random countries. There is no ""long term economic plan"" other than to grift and enrich the already super rich.


This is also why they passed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"". Raise the debt ceiling to borrow more money, slash taxes for the billionaires, and destroy public services.

Seeing the comments about overseas Pinoys mostly voting MAGA is very disheartening. You left the Philippines because of the rampant corruption, and that you thought there was no opportunity for you to prosper there, yet you actively want the same shit to happen to your new home countries.

\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a series of sweeping trade deals with Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, touting them as landmark achievements in his administration's drive to rebalance global trade before new tariff levels take effect August 1.\
\
In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump called the deal with Japan ""perhaps the largest Deal ever made,"" declaring that the U.S. would receive 90% of profits from a $550 billion investment by Japan into the American economy. The agreement also includes expanded access for U.S. products--particularly automobiles, rice, and other agricultural goods--into the Japanese market. In return, Japan will pay a 15% reciprocal tariff on its exports to the U.S., a reduction from the 25% Trump previously proposed.\
\
""This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs--There has never been anything like it,"" Trump wrote. ""This is a very exciting time for the United States of America.""\
\
While Japanese officials have not yet confirmed all the details, the announcement represents a significant breakthrough in trade negotiations that had stalled for months over auto tariffs and national security-related levies. The agreement's terms remain unclear on whether Japan will be exempted from separate 25% tariffs on automobiles or 50% on steel and aluminum.\
\
Earlier Tuesday, the Trump administration released full details of a $50 billion trade framework with Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous nation. The deal eliminates tariffs on 99% of American exports to Indonesia and slashes U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from a threatened 32% to 19%. However, goods with substantial content from third-party nations like China will be subject to a steep 40% levy under new transshipment rules.\
\
""This deal is a HUGE WIN for our Automakers, Tech Companies, Workers, Farmers, Ranchers, and Manufacturers,"" Trump said, highlighting Indonesia's commitments to purchase U.S. aircraft, energy, and agricultural goods. Indonesia also agreed to accept U.S. safety standards for cars and medical equipment, remove pre-shipment inspections, drop plans to tax cross-border digital services, and supply critical minerals vital to U.S. industries.\
\
The Indonesia agreement also includes enforceable labor provisions--banning forced labor imports and guaranteeing workers' rights to collective bargaining. White House officials confirmed the deal resolves multiple longstanding grievances outlined in the U.S. Trade Representative's 2025 National Trade Estimate Report.\
\
Later in the day, President Trump confirmed the finalization of a U.S.-Philippines trade and military partnership following a White House meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Under the agreement, Filipino exports to the U.S. will face a 19% tariff, while U.S. goods will enter the Philippines duty-free. Trump had previously warned of a 20% tariff if a deal wasn't reached by August 1.\
\
""It was a beautiful visit, and we concluded our Trade Deal, whereby The Philippines is going OPEN MARKET with the United States, and ZERO Tariffs,"" Trump wrote. ""He  is a very good, and tough, negotiator.""\
\
The deal includes provisions to remove import restrictions, resolve longstanding intellectual property disputes, and open negotiations on digital trade, services, and investment. A military cooperation clause was also established, though specific terms remain undisclosed.\
\
Together, the three agreements mark the latest chapter in Trump's aggressive bilateral trade reset ahead of his self-imposed August 1 deadline. The president has issued letters to dozens of nations, demanding new trade terms or risk facing preset tariff rates. So far, new deals have been concluded with the U.K., Vietnam, and now Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\
\
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Tuesday that an upcoming deadline with China might be extended. ""We've actually moved to a new level with China,"" Bessent said, noting that Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson will host the next round of U.S.-China trade talks.\
\
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added that the U.S. intends to impose a baseline 10% tariff on small economies across Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa unless favorable deals are reached. ""Bigger economies will either open themselves up or they'll pay a fair tariff to America,"" Lutnick said.\
\
As Trump moves forward with broader tariff policies, he continues to defend the economic strategy as a way to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., fund domestic priorities, and reduce trade deficits. White House officials insisted the administration expects minimal inflationary impact, citing complementary tax cuts and investment incentives passed earlier this month.\
\
With just days left before the August deadline, attention now shifts to upcoming executive orders that will implement the announced deals--and to further negotiations with remaining holdout countries, particularly within the European Union. \

2025-07-24,2025-07-24 22:05:53,Reddit,search_result,FluentInFinance,Winning the Tariff War: Can the World Economy Handle the Consequences?,"President Trump announced last Tuesday night that a 15% tariff trade agreement with Japan, up from the previous rate of 2%, including the important Japanese automotive industry. This would increase Japan’s tariff payments from last year's $16 billion to $126 billion, which will help pay down the US debt.

The Japan deal came on the heels of two other deals with Indonesia and the Philippines. The Indonesia deal alone increases the Indonesia tariff payments from last year's $1 billion to just over $7 billion.

Trump knows the US market is the biggest customer in the world, and he thinks other countries should pay for access to US customers and the protection of the U.S. military. So far, the different countries are agreeing to higher tariffs after doing the math of what the consequences would be to their economies if they were priced out of the US market or lost access to it.

The US is earning serious money from tariffs. In June alone, the US Treasury collected $27 billion in customs revenue, a $20 billion increase from June 2024, and it will get even higher after the Japan tariff kicks in.

Although media headlines might suggest that the US is lowering its tariffs, the fact of the matter is that the US is increasing tariffs at a rapid rate. The average effective tariff on all US imports as of July 2nd was just over 13%, well above the 2% rate in 2024, according to JPMorgan Chase, which is the highest since before World War II.

The risk is that Trump could push other countries into tariffs further than what the markets can tolerate. With all the tariff fears, investors might expect the global economy to show signs of slowing, but the US markets are again at all-time highs, and global growth remains a solid 2.5%. Investment, spending, and international trade are all positive, despite the worldwide reworking of the tariff system.

The big fish yet to land is the European Union (EU). The Japan agreement has given the EU optimism that it might be able to achieve a 15% rate, which would be negligible for its markets. They may not like paying more, but they realize they need the US more than the US needs them. That is the penalty for having the weaker hand at the negotiating table.

The China deal isn’t finalized yet, but it will likely remain around 40%. Canada and Mexico, like the EU, need the US consumer more than the US consumer needs them. Our North American neighbors may not like it, but they will eventually agree to higher tariffs, albeit at a lower rate than the rest of the world. For the stock market, the important thing is that a 15% overall rate, like Japan agreed to, is back in play. And markets seem able to handle it.

The US is the world’s largest economy and has the largest military. This means that other countries need the US more than the US needs them, and the US is able to dictate terms, which others must live with. So far, the maket likes it, but let’s hope the deals are not too lopsided as to hamstring the world's economy in the future.

[www.FerventWM.com](http://www.ferventwm.com/)","Winning the Tariff War: Can the World Economy Handle the Consequences? President Trump announced last Tuesday night that a 15% tariff trade agreement with Japan, up from the previous rate of 2%, including the important Japanese automotive industry. This would increase Japan’s tariff payments from last year's $16 billion to $126 billion, which will help pay down the US debt.

The Japan deal came on the heels of two other deals with Indonesia and the Philippines. The Indonesia deal alone increases the Indonesia tariff payments from last year's $1 billion to just over $7 billion.

Trump knows the US market is the biggest customer in the world, and he thinks other countries should pay for access to US customers and the protection of the U.S. military. So far, the different countries are agreeing to higher tariffs after doing the math of what the consequences would be to their economies if they were priced out of the US market or lost access to it.

The US is earning serious money from tariffs. In June alone, the US Treasury collected $27 billion in customs revenue, a $20 billion increase from June 2024, and it will get even higher after the Japan tariff kicks in.

Although media headlines might suggest that the US is lowering its tariffs, the fact of the matter is that the US is increasing tariffs at a rapid rate. The average effective tariff on all US imports as of July 2nd was just over 13%, well above the 2% rate in 2024, according to JPMorgan Chase, which is the highest since before World War II.

The risk is that Trump could push other countries into tariffs further than what the markets can tolerate. With all the tariff fears, investors might expect the global economy to show signs of slowing, but the US markets are again at all-time highs, and global growth remains a solid 2.5%. Investment, spending, and international trade are all positive, despite the worldwide reworking of the tariff system.

The big fish yet to land is the European Union (EU). The Japan agreement has given the EU optimism that it might be able to achieve a 15% rate, which would be negligible for its markets. They may not like paying more, but they realize they need the US more than the US needs them. That is the penalty for having the weaker hand at the negotiating table.

The China deal isn’t finalized yet, but it will likely remain around 40%. Canada and Mexico, like the EU, need the US consumer more than the US consumer needs them. Our North American neighbors may not like it, but they will eventually agree to higher tariffs, albeit at a lower rate than the rest of the world. For the stock market, the important thing is that a 15% overall rate, like Japan agreed to, is back in play. And markets seem able to handle it.

The US is the world’s largest economy and has the largest military. This means that other countries need the US more than the US needs them, and the US is able to dictate terms, which others must live with. So far, the maket likes it, but let’s hope the deals are not too lopsided as to hamstring the world's economy in the future.
