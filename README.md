# Impact of US Tariffs on Philippine Food Company Stocks

## Project Overview
This Business Intelligence case study analyzes how Trump administration tariffs affected publicly listed Philippine food companies' stock prices. We combine financial market data with Reddit sentiment analysis to understand both market and public reaction to the tariff announcements.

## Key Questions
1. How did stock volatility change after tariff announcements?
2. What were the moving average trends before/after key dates?
3. Is there correlation between public sentiment and stock performance?
4. What was the public sentiment regarding Philippine food exports?

## Key Findings

### **Stock Market Impact**
- **Increased Volatility**: All 5 companies showed heightened volatility after Trump's inauguration (Jan 20, 2025)
- **Price Decline**: Average stock prices dropped significantly following tariff escalations
- **JFC** (Jollibee): Most resilient with smaller percentage decline
- **MONDE** (Monde Nissin): Experienced highest volatility increase
- **Statistical Significance**: T-tests confirmed significant changes in daily returns for most companies

### **Moving Average Analysis**
- **7-day MA**: Sharp downward trend after April 2 (17% tariff announcement)
- **30-day MA**: Sustained decline throughout the tariff period
- **Recovery Patterns**: Minor stabilization after July 22 Marcos-Trump meeting (19% final rate)

### **Public Sentiment Analysis**
- **Overall Sentiment**: Predominantly negative (-0.19 average sentiment score)
- **Reddit Activity**: 34 posts/comments analyzed across multiple subreddits
- **Peak Negativity**: July 2025 during 20% tariff announcement period
- **Sentiment Distribution**: 41% Negative, 35% Neutral, 24% Positive
- **Correlation**: Weak but noticeable correlation between negative sentiment and stock declines

### **Timeline of Key Events**
1. **Jan 20, 2025**: Trump inauguration - Initial market uncertainty
2. **Apr 2, 2025**: 17% tariff announcement - First major stock decline
3. **Jul 9, 2025**: 20% tariff escalation - Peak negative sentiment
4. **Jul 22, 2025**: Negotiated reduction to 19% - Minor recovery

### **Investment Implications**
- **Sector Vulnerability**: Philippine food exporters highly sensitive to US trade policy
- **Diversification Need**: Companies with heavy US export dependency face ongoing risks
- **Policy Hedge**: Diplomatic engagement showed ability to mitigate worst-case scenarios

## Technologies Used
- **R Studio**: Stock price analysis, volatility calculations
- **Python**: Sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob), Reddit scraping
- **Tableau**: Data visualization dashboard
- **Excel**: Data storage and summary reports

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R (v4.0+) with packages: `readxl`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `zoo`, `corrplot`
- Python (v3.8+) with packages: `pandas`, `nltk`, `textblob`, `requests`
- Tableau Desktop (for dashboard creation)

### Running the Analysis (Execute in this order)

**1. Sentiment Analysis First (Python):**
```bash
python SentimentAnalysis.py
```
*This generates `reddit_sentiment_detailed.csv` and `reddit_daily_summary.csv` required by the R analysis.*

**2. Stock Analysis Second (R):**
```r
# Set working directory
setwd("path/to/ISBUSAN-CaseStudy")

# Run main analysis (requires sentiment files from step 1)
source("FoodTariffDataAnalysis.R")
```

**3. Tableau Dashboard:**
- Open Tableau Desktop
- Import `Philippine_Food_Stocks_Tableau.csv` (generated by R script)
- Create visualizations using the structured data

### Output Files
After running both scripts, you'll have:
- Complete analysis in `Tariff_Impact_Analysis_Complete.xlsx`
- Visualization files (`.png` charts)
- Tableau-ready dataset

**Note:** The R script depends on sentiment data from the Python script, so Python must run first.
